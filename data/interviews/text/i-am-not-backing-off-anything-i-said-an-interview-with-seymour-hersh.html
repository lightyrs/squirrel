 <div class="text text-1 parbase section"> <p>In <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden">a blockbuster 10,000-word story for the<em> London Review of Books</em></a>this week, longtime <em>New Yorker</em> investigative journalist Seymour Hersh called into question the official account of the American raid that killed Osama Bin Laden, and argued that what is arguably seen as the apex of Barack Obama's presidency is actually built on a lie.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-2 text parbase section"> <p>Hersh's piece claims that Bin Laden was being held prisoner by the Pakistani military and intelligence service (the ISI), who were using him as a means to control Taliban and al-Qaida elements, and hoping to use him as leverage in their relationship with the United States. According to Hersh, who relied largely on an anonymous intelligence source, the Obama administration found out that Pakistan had Bin Laden, and eventually convinced Pakistani military leaders to allow a raid on the compound where Bin Laden was being held. The plan, Hersh writes, was to say publicly that Bin Laden was killed not in the raid but in a drone strike. The White House, however, supposedly broke this deal because of the political value of making the details of the raid public.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-3 text parbase section"> <p>Hersh's story has been much debated over the past several days, with many calling it into question and (a comparable few) others applauding its willingness to undercut the official narrative. NBC News and the AFP have both backed up small elements of Hersh's story, although both outlets have also called other elements of his piece into question (and NBC later <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/05/13/nbc_walk_in_retraction_seymour_hersh_detail_about_location_of_bin_laden.html">backed away</a> from its original reporting). And no news source has supported Hersh's largest claimâthat the president lied about the raid.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-4 section"> <p>I spoke to Hersh by phone this week. Here is a transcript of our conversation, which has been slightly condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-5 section"> <p><strong>Isaac Chotiner: </strong>If the plan until the night of the raid was to use the cover story that he had not been killed in a raid but in a drone strike, then why have the raid at all?Â  Why not just have the Pakistanis kill him? Why risk Obama's presidency?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-6 parbase section"> <p><strong>Seymour Hersh:</strong> Of course there is no answer there because I haven't talked to any of the principals. But I can just give you what the people who were in the process believed to be so, which is that for [Gens.] Pasha and Kayani, the chance of something like that getting leaked out would be devastating. America was then running at about 8 percent popularity in Pakistan, and Bin Laden was running at 60, 70 percent. He was very popular. [Editor's note: <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-largely-discredited-among-muslim-publics-in-recent-years/http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-largely-discredited-among-muslim-publics-in-recent-years/">This 2010 opinion poll</a> says that Bin Laden's popularity was at 18 percent in Pakistan.] You couldn't just take a chance, because if someone ratted you outâI can only give you a basic theory.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-7 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> It just seems like a huge raid with Pakistani complicity brings up just as many problems for the Pakistanis.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text parbase text-8 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> If you believe, as a smart guy said to me, if anybody, if anyone didn't think the president was going to fuck [the Pakistani military] they are out of their mind. He was always going to fuck them.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-9 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner: </strong>OK. In your piece you call into question that the Americans got valuable documents in the raid. But Ayman al-Zawahiri, the current head of al-Qaida, himself seemed to confirm that this was true. How do you handle that contradiction?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-10 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I handle it pretty easy. [Laughs] The issue for me is the treasure trove issue. Did the SEALS take out piles of computers? There were claims they found computers and disks and sticks, what do they call those sticks?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-11 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I don't know.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-12 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> You're not as old as I am. You should know that. Anyway, the SEALs mission was to go kill the guy. They did pick up some papers, but most of the papers were delivered by the ISI. He was a prisoner under their control. He wasn't beaten and could walk around but it was a prison. He couldn't get out. They kept encouraging him to write stuff. And he did. But I am bothered by the contradictions. [The] president said it was a treasure trove so there had to be a treasure trove. Is it real? I don't know. It was used in a trial. Is it real? Is it not? I don't know.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-13 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner: </strong>You seem slightly annoyed that Obama double-crossed the Pakistanis.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-14 parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Double-crossed is your word.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-15 parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> OK fine. I want to understand why you seem bothered by that, aside from the lying. Turning our back on the worst elements in Pakistan who we have long nurtured doesn't seem so bad. We have supported them forever.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-16 section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>Why do we do that?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-17 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Because we see it as being in our own interest.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-18 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Well no, we do it for nukes.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-19 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Fine, we see that as being in our interest.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase section text-20"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> In my experience in the last 30 years, one of the major worries was about the "Islamic bomb," about Pakistan. If you knew the lengths to which we go, working with the ISI, to make sure some ultranationalist or ultrajihadist doesn't get [control of nukes].</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-21 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Yes, although you could argue that if we hadn't nurtured these elements for so long, the country would be less of a threat.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-22 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> You could argue anything.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text-24 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Swing away fella.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text parbase text-26 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> You probably don't know that NBC reported, and now they have reported it on one of these dopey afternoon shows with that woman, what's her name, the NBC woman who claims to have some knowledge of foreign policy, married to Alan Greenspan.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-27 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner: </strong>Andrea Mitchell.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-28 parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> She's comical. On her show the administration is acknowledging walk-ins but saying the walk-ins aren't necessarily linked to Bin Laden.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-29 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> The AFP <a href="http://www.dawn.com/news/1181530/pakistan-military-officials-admit-defectors-key-role-in-bin-laden-operation">piece</a>, which you sent me approvingly, says the same thing, that there is no evidence the walk-in led to Bin Laden, and that the walk-in did not even know the target was Bin Laden.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-30 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Uh huh, OK.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text parbase text-32 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Oh poor you, you don't know anything. It is amazing you can speak the God's English.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase section text-33"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Are you hoping with this piece to say that you made no mistakes, or that OK there were mistakes because I am getting the ball rolling? You have quoted two pieces very approvingly, from NBC and AFP, that differ from key points in your own story. I want to know how accurate you think your story now is.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-34 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> [Laughs loudly] Well I will tell you one thing: At one point a copy editor in England confronted me about the SEALs training in Nevada and changed it to Utah, and the line made it because according to her they were sort of the same.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-35 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> The AFP piece contradicts your piece but you aren't running around worried about that.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-36 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I sent it approvingly because it crossed my desk and it does say there were walk-ins. [Laughs] You can read it any way you want. The White House has been very clever about this. They have gone after me personally. They don't like me <em>boo hoo hoo</em>. But they have been very careful to hedge everything, they quote Peter Bergen. Bergen or Berger, is that his name?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-37 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Bergen.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-38 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> They quote him. He views himself as the trustee of all things Bin Laden.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-39 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I just want to talk to you about your piece and journalism.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-40 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> What difference does it make what the fuck I think about journalism? I don't think much of the journalism that I see. If you think I write stories where it is all right to just be good enough, are you kidding? You think I have a cavalier attitude on throwing stuff out? Are you kidding? I am not cavalier about what I do for a living.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-41 parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I don't think you are cavalier. That was not my question.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-42 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>Whatever it is, it's an impossible question. It's almost like you are asking me to say that there are flaws in everybody. Yes. Do I acknowledge that not everybody can be perfect? But I am not backing off anything I said.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text-43 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Well let's talk about sources. A lot of the reporting that got us into the last stupid war was based on bad and often anonymous sources. Is there a problem with journalists having a limited number of sources, just generally speaking? Is this a problem? With unnamed sourcesâ</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-44 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Are you kidding me? Unnamed sources? You are smarter than that. This is too boring.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-45 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Let me finish my question and then you can yell at me.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase section text-46"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I am done yelling.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-47 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Is there some sort of journalistic standard that reporters should try to meet to prevent more errors?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-48 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Let me say something to you. There was a practice at the<em> New Yorker</em> that continued at the<em> London Review of Books</em>. The reason I like the <em>LRB</em> is that it isn't tied down to Americana. It is more open to being ... In Europe people think this story makes sense. There is not the quibbling. It is a different approach. By that I mean that the view of America is less cheery abroad but the standards are the same. The people at the <em>London Review</em> knew whom I talked to. It is the same at the<em> New Yorker</em>. David Remnick knows who I talk to. I do have sources, which is a problem for a lot of people that don't.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text parbase text-50 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I just said what I said. I don't want to hear what the upshot is. If you have another question then ask it. This is going on too long. I am too old and too cranky and too tired. I have been doing this fucking thing for a day. I told you, I warned you, that I am really irritable.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text-52 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Now you are restating it. In Europe it is an easier path. The notion that somehow AmericaâI have one slight layer less. Believe me. I don't know if you know who Mary-Kay Wilmers is. You probably don't.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-53 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> She is the editor of the <em>LRB</em>.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-54 parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Do you know how smart she is?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-55 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I have heard stories.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-56 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> She is fantastic. She is as good as they say. They go gaga over her. She was married to Stephen Frears. She is tenacious. But believe me this piece took a long time to get into print. A lot of questions. A lot of nasty questions.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text parbase text-58 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Don't turn this into some sort of profound anti-American statement.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase section text-59"> <p><strong>Chotiner: </strong>It seems like you are hinting the<em> New Yorker</em> rejected it for reasons having to do with politics.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-60 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>Would you care to hear the truth? Would you care to hear something that didn't come from <em>Vox</em>, whoever <em>Vox</em> is? I am not sure you are that interested in it. I am doing a book. Within four or five days I hear that there are problems with the [official] OBL story. A lot of problems. And I have good friends in Pakistan. Really good friends. I go there a lot. Hold on, I just walked out of a two-room suite and the fucking movie crew. The fucking movie crew just leaves the desk. God dammit. [A film crew had been in Hersh's office.] Anyway. First of all, you may get some suggestion of this. Maybe I am not an easy guy.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-61 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I wouldn't dream of suggesting that.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-62 section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>There was a point with the<em> New Yorker</em> where I thought they should rename the fucking magazine the<em> Seymour Hersh Weekly</em>. David Remnick has his own theories and opinions. He is not cowed by me. We have a lot of fights. We have a lot of disagreements. I don't find that so shocking. I like him a lot, he is brilliant, he is great. I think he is even a better writer than editor. I have always been a freelancer. I always work for myself.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-63 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I get that.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-64 parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> So, all that happens is I tell him about the story, and his initial approach was to say do a blog item. Go fuck yourself! A blog? I have done a couple blogs when it is 1,000 words but this is worth more. At that point it was very early. So I was on contract for a book and said fuck it â¦ You want to make a lot out of it? David always says he welcomes another view. I am the guy who said fuck it, I will do what I want to do. [Editor's note: Other <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/the-new-yorker-passed-on-seymour-hershs-bin-laden-206933.html">news sources</a> have reported that the<em> New Yorker</em> declined to publish a version of the story.]</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-65 section"> <p><strong>[Hersh picks up other phone]:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Oh no, fuck no â¦ I don't want to do it there! Go fuckâ</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-66 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> You there?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-67 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> Yes.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-68 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Fucking TV interview sets up in the hall of my office building. It's a lawyer's building.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text-70 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> You want to write about this totally tedious shit? Yes, I am a huge pain in the ass. I am the one that decided to publish it wherever the hell I please. That's the story. You want to listen to hall gossip about me? Go ahead. [Sarcastic voice] It is so immensely important to so many people to know where I published. I can't believe it.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text-71 text parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner: </strong>Can I tell you why?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-72 parbase section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I don't want to hear why. You think there is a different standard in London?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text text-73 parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I wish you would listen.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-74 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> All right, maybe I will listen, but I gotta hang up.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-75 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> If people here are turning down stories because of certain politicsâyou yourself said it was easier in Europeâthat is a story that should be written.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-76 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> Now you said the first intelligent thing you have said. If you had asked whether he didn't run this because he is in love with Obama and all that stuff that people think, no â¦ It is a very good question. Although we have huge disagreements. My children and I have huge disagreements. I have a huge disagreement with my dog. We have a lot of disagreements and there are times when he will call me and I will not answer the call. Oh fuck hold on. He always has said to me he welcomes any information and it was I who said fuck it.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-77 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> OK but you have talked about the <em>New Yorker</em>'s Americana and said my question was a good one, so is there something to it?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-78 section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>I think it is a great question.</p>

 </div>

  <div class="text text-79 parbase section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> So what do you think of it?</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase section text-80"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> I just told you what I think. In the case of the Bin Laden story, he is open for anything. It was I who made the decision.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-81 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> I feel like you are telling me two different things. One is that you get less pressure in Europe, and the other is that this story would have been fine at the<em> New Yorker</em>.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-82 section"> <p><strong>Hersh:</strong> So fine, I am glad you are confused. Write whichever one makes you happy.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-83 section"> <p><strong>Chotiner:</strong> OK.</p>

 </div>

 <div class="text parbase text-84 section"> <p><strong>Hersh: </strong>I don't mean to yell at you but I feel good doing it. Goodbye.</p>

 </div>

</div>
