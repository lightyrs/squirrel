<div class="text"> 8/27/12<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> Hey folks! It is now 6pm. You know what that means. It is interview time! Let us begin.</h4>


<thefluffyshrimp> Here is how the interview works: You can all ask questions and chat freely in the chatroom called AtAChat. I will be copy-pasting your questions to Alexiuss and he will answer them in live time in ATAInterview.<thefluffyshrimp> We conduct the interview this way to avoid having the artist spammed with too many questions all at once, and to reduce text clutter so that you can all read the artist's responses to the questions.<thefluffyshrimp> A special thank you goes out to our lovely mods, ~Melancholy-Minds and ~Twilight-Zero!<thefluffyshrimp> Please be aware that we do our best to get as many questions answered as possible, however, if we do not choose your question to send to the artist, please do not be offended. It does not mean it was not a good question. It is just not possible for the artist to answer all questions. Thank you for your understanding.<thefluffyshrimp> Welcome to ASKtheARTIST. My name is *thefluffyshrimp and today I have the great privilege to interview `alexiuss, an incredibly talented artist and creator of Romantically Apocalyptic.<thefluffyshrimp> Thank you for presenting us with this opportunity to interview you, Alexiuss.<p><alexiuss> AND I AM YOUR INTERVIEWEEEEE. ALEXIUS, THE LORD OF ALL THINGS BUTTER, ARCHITECT OF DISASTER IKEA DRAWERS, CONTROLLER OF ANTARCTIC RAIN AND OTHER LONG AND WINDING TITLES WHICH I AM TOO LAZY TO LIST HERE.<alexiuss> I am currently being stalked by rain clouds, so if I suddenly vanish from this interview do not blame me and start assembling a team of torches and pitchforks, instead direct your infinite fury towards the rain clouds.<alexiuss> The clouds are the oppressors of my Internet connections.<alexiuss> They are also to blame for my horrible typing skills because the endless valley of lightning outside my cardboard bastion is distracting me with its flashiness.<alexiuss> Remember to make your pitchforks of non-metal things if you are to wage a war against the clouds, for the lightning is a fickle mistress.</p>

<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~yourgrandaddy asks "Will there be a final fight between pilot and kittyhawk any time soon?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> There will not.<alexiuss> Their battle is eternal and will echo through all time, until the death of the known visible universe through unfortunate shrinkage.<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~MadDohap asks "What mood are you in when making your comics?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> My mood depends not on making comics but rather on the conditions of my household war. Currently the war is at level 4 AMBER ALERT. This means I must watch out for being scratched or hit with a semi-soft object like a female fist.<alexiuss> Currently I am working on releasing episode 102 of the comic, so the mood is mild and I am slightly distracted.<alexiuss> Also I have horrible allergies, caused by unknown plants possibly of alien origins for no human pills work against them.<alexiuss> I am pondering of going to Greenland or Antarctica for two weeks, just because NOTHING GROWS THERE.<alexiuss> Mood is affected by the multiple persons who occupy my house castle.<alexiuss> They are currently shouting at each other about broken arms, awkward situations, cats, brothers and finding items.<alexiuss> And captain being moth-man.<alexiuss> And turtle-buses. And monster-legends.<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Hawkpath-tail asks "Where'd you get the ideas for your characters?" and ~SucittarSucivron asks "Were your characters inspired by people you know in your life?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Ideas for characters are based on real people I know in my organic existence and various TV episodes of interest that I enjoy watching such as "Invader Zim" or Russian movies which you probably won't know like the "Twelve chairs."<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~antillanka, ~laroku1, and ~Keilythefox asks "What inspired you to do RA?" and "What inspires your art [in general]? Is it a person, place, animal or what?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> RA is inspired by the following things: My adventures around the world aka "Urban Exploration"; a hobby of mine where I find abandoned buildings and photograph them.<alexiuss> The style of RA is inspired by works of Russian seascape painter "Aivazovsky."<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~yourgrandaddy asks "Are there anymore giant robots just sitting around, waiting to be assimilated into captains army?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Yeah there will be lots!<alexiuss> Just wait and see.<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> *Azrethr asks "Alexiuss, when did you first start taking an interest in art?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> My interest in art started before I was born. My organic parental unit decided that I should become an artist and so she married one, thus acquiring the genetic codes necessary for an artist son.<alexiuss> I had no choice in the matter.<alexiuss> And that is rather delicious, like winning a lottery without buying a lottery ticket. I am set for life with artistic superpowers.<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~SucittarSucivron asks "Will zee captain encounter more minions on his quest to stop the universe from shrinking?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> The captain has 4 main minions right now. The probability of acquiring more minions is low due to several factoids decimating human life on earth.<alexiuss> However Captain will try Captain's hardest!<alexiuss> Many "JOIN CAPTAIN'S ARMY" notes were dispersed throughout the wastelands.<alexiuss> Including treasure maps for those seeking enlightenment!<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~KidOblivion asks "How do you feel about fan characters? Do they inspire you? Do you find them annoying/amusing? Do you rub your hands together with an evil smile thinking how easy it is to take over the world?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Fan characters are sexy. I approve of them and demand MOAR.<alexiuss> Whenever I fly somewhere, be it London or New York I read up on the latest RA fanfiction submissions.<alexiuss> As for rubbing hands...<alexiuss>I prefer to rub other things, such as:<alexiuss> CATS<alexiuss> BALD HEADS<alexiuss> LADIES' PRIVATES<alexiuss> 95% POLYESTER ITEMS<alexiuss> CORK<alexiuss>(I even bought a cork cube just to rub it.)<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~yourgrandaddy asks "Will Snippy ever snipe anything?" and ~Hawkpath-tail asks "Is Snippy really suffering from radiation poisoning?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Snippy's sniping career has just begun. He is not suffering from radiation poisoning, because he always eats his potassium iodine pills on time....<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~yourgrandaddy asks "Will TV Head ever make a return?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> I appear to be duplicating.<alexiuss> STAY TUNED AS WE SORT OUT THESE SHENANIGANS OF THE NET.<alexiuss> THE UNIVERSE APPEARS TO BE EXPERIENCING TEMPORAL DIFFICULTIES.<p><b><Alexius> GREETINGS ALL MATTER OF BEINGS.<Alexius> I COME FROM THE PAST.<Alexius> TO WARN YOU OF A HORRIBLE FUTURE.<Alexius> UNFORTUNATELY I FORGOT WHAT IT WAS DUE TO EFFECTS OF TIME DISPLACEMENTS.</b><alexiuss> Great, now I will never known what doom is to come.<alexiuss> Back to questions, the "TV Head" will be back.<b><Alexius> BACK FOR MOAR.<Alexius> THAT QUESTION WAS BORING.<Alexius> I DEMAND BETTER QUESTIONS, LESS BOOBISH.</b><alexiuss> No, I consider that question only 17% boobish.<b><Alexius> IN THE PLACE WHERE I COME FROM THEY WOULD HAVE LICKED YOU TO DEATH FOR THIS QUESTION.</b><alexiuss> Really?<b><Alexius> TO THE DEATH!!!<Alexius> IF A LESS BOOBISH QUESTION IS NOT ASKED WITHIN THE NEXT 17.4 MINUTES THE DISASTER WILL NOT BE AVERTED.</b><alexiuss> How do you know?<b><Alexius> THE TATTOO ON MY FOREHEAD SAYS SO, UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE REFLECTIVE SURFACES HERE ARE DIRTY SO I CANNOT DISCOMBOBULATE IT PROPERLY.<Alexius> IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR ALL TIME TRAVELLING ORGANICS TO TATTOO SUCH REMINDERS ON THEMSELVES DUE TO TEMPORAL LOSS OF MENTAL CAPACITIES.</b></p>

<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~SucittarSucivron asks "Who are your personal favorite artists?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> From the classics: Ivan Aivazovsky, Roerich, Salvador Dali.<p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~MadDoHap asks "As I remember it, you just got married. Has the marriage influenced your art in a different way, than your relationship prior to the marriage?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Hmmm.... That is a tough one. I can barely remember anything before the marriage due to memory loss. Flying a lot to conventions results in lack of sleep, which results in massive gaps in memories. Learn your lesson kids, and sleep on time... because if you don't you will not remember your past selves.<b><Alexius> THIS QUESTION IS NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH. THERE ARE MANY TATTOES ON MY BODY BUT NONE TO ANSWER THIS ONE. IF I HAD TO MAKE A WILD GUESS DISCERNING FROM MY DISHEVELLED APPEARANCES THE PAST IS A HORRIBLE PLACE AND BEING MARRIED HAS MADE ME HAPPIER AT LEAST 473 PERCENT.</b><p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Twilight-Zero asks "If Alexius is from the past, and warning of disaster in the future which we are in now for him, how has this paradox not destroyed the universe yet, or at least called the Doctor to this madness."
</h4>


<alexiuss> Uhhh....<b><Alexius> THE DOCTOR IS TOO SLOW. WE ARE RUNNING ON PST TIME AS YOU MIGHT HAVE READ FROM INTERVIEW ANNOUNCING LABEL. THE DOCTOR IS IN ENGLAND IN GMT TIME.<Alexius> TO CROSS ALL THE TIME ZONES THE DOCTOR WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL FOR A WHOLE DAY. BY THE TIME HE GETS HERE, THE INTERVIEW WILL BE OVER.<Alexius> AND YOU WILL ALL BE GONE.<Alexius> REPLACED BY YOUR FUTURE SELVES.<Alexius> SLEEP BRINGS ON A DIFFERENT YOU, A COPY OF YOU THAT ISN'T YOU.</b><alexiuss> I wonder if there's a moral here. Sleep more or sleep less?<b><Alexius> MORALS ARE FOR BOOBS. I DECLARE POLL TIME.</b><alexiuss> A wild poll has sprung up: <p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~NikkiNokko asks "When did you first start using digital art?" and ~TaroNeko asks "At what age did you start drawing?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> I started drawing when I was 4 years old. Digital art was started around 2001-ish. Whenever it was when I got hideously annoyed with traditional art.<b><Alexius> THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT MY AGE AND WHEN I STARTED DRAWING SHOW YOUR LAZINESS. THE DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE APPROACHES, READ MY BIO FIRST, THEN ASK QUESTIONS: </b><p>...</p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~TheOneWhoLovesToEat asks "Boxers or briefs?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Boxers!<b><Alexius> TIME TRAVELERS ARE NAKED, DO YOU PEOPLE KNOW NOTHING? WHO AM I DEALING WITH? WHY HAVEN'T ANYONE WATCHED TERMINATOR?<Alexius> CLOTHES ARE IRRELEVANT AND ANNOYING. IF I WOULD HAVE THE POWER, I WOULD MAKE ALL YOUR CLOTHES VANISH RIGHT NOW... THAT IS HOW MUCH CLOTHES AGITATE ME.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Guillo-Carregha asks "How much time does it take to make each page?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> It is impossible to calculate the time to make each page due to several factoids:<alexiuss> 1) I plan each page, the planning sometimes takes years. For example, episode 100 of the comic was written two years ago.<alexiuss> 2) I shoot textures for each page. The shoots that take me all around the planet take from 2-10 hours.<alexiuss> 3) I design custom textures and structures for each page. These are drawn over the years and sit on my hard drives in gigabytes of information, photographs, images, textures, brushes, etc.<alexiuss> 4) Very often each page contains pieces of old artworks; some of which took me months to paint.<alexiuss> Thus, each page takes years on average.<alexiuss> And each page also takes one week, because I post the comic every weekend.<alexiuss> Except this weekend, the page is horribly late because FAN EXPO show took me all week to set up and to attend.<b><Alexius> THE CURRENT PAGE WILL BE POSTED WHEN THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~SucittarSucivron asks "What comes first in creating a page in RA comic, the images or the script or something else?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Also impossible to answer. In some pages the imagery comes first, in others the story. It's a hideous variety.<b><Alexius> WHAT CAME FIRST: THE SHOE OR THE SHOELACE?</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Lag-Wizard asks "Is Stalky going to become integral to the plot, or is he going to remain as part of his own mini story?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Stalky will continue to appear as long as a)The awesome creator of stalky ~zerrnichter will keep on drawing Stalky pages.<alexiuss> and b) As long as fans support Stalky. If the fans desire him to die, he will most certainly perish.<b><Alexius> THE PEOPLE SHALL VOTE ON STALKY'S FATE OF DOOM.<Alexius> ALSO, I PREDICT THAT EPISODE 102 WILL FEATURE STALKY.<Alexius> BECAUSE SO IT IS WRITTEN ON MY ELBOW.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~DomesticHeart asks "How much trial and error did the characters go through before they became what they are today, personality and appearance-wise?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> None at all.<alexiuss> I planted the outfits that I've had in the dirt of the comic's website and their personalities grew out of the soil that is the community that reads RA.<alexiuss> And such plants take on their own shape. You know only slightly what to expect.<b><Alexius> ALL THE SECOND HAND SHOPS WERE RAIDED FOR FINDING THE OUTFITS THAT THE CHARACTER CURRENTLY WEAR IN THE COMIC!</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~SucittarSucivron asks "Who are the 'actors' for RA?"
</h4>

<b><Alexius> ANOTHER BOOBISH QUESTION! GO TOÂ Â AND SCROLL DOWN UNTIL YOU SEE "ROMANTICALLY APOCALYPTIC TEAM AND CONTRIBUTORS."<Alexius> THE ONLY CORE CONTRIBUTOR NOT LISTED IS CHICO BECAUSE HE DOES NOT USE HIS DEVIANTART ENOUGH.<Alexius> AS HE SPEAKS IN RIDDLES AND WALKS IN SHOES OF MADNESS.<Alexius> ALSO OTHER MODELS ARE SHOT AS RA CHARACTERS WHENEVER THEY CRASH THE STUDIO.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~meimcrae asks "So will you continue the new story line about the human in that space ship where you spent an incredibly large amount of points to just get coffee?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> meimcrae's question confuses me.<alexiuss> As it either refers to  which has spaceships or to Snippy's life of doom which has expensive coffee.<alexiuss> So to answer both; Carnagenesis will eventually be integrated into RA.<alexiuss> Just wait and see.<alexiuss> Snippy's life of doom will also be portrayed more, if the delicious artist ~grimhel (feel free to go to her page and to give her hugs) will draw more of Snippy's past life of doom.<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~ZhonLord asks "Wait, if fans desiring Stalky to die will actually make it happen, does that mean we have the ability to access your world and control events in it? If so, what would happen if we decided we didn't WANT the terrible future event Alexiuss came back to warn us about, to happen?"
</h4>

<b><Alexius> WHEN YOU OBSERVE THE SINGULARITY IT COLLAPSES.<Alexius> THAT IS THE HUMAN CONDITION.<Alexius> STOP OBSERVING THINGS.<Alexius> EVERYONE EVACUATE THE INTERVIEW IMMEDIATELY.<Alexius> BY BEING HERE YOU ARE PROLONGING YOUR OWN DOOM.<Alexius> DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!<Alexius> STOP JOINING YOU FOOLS!<Alexius> I SAID EVACUATE!<Alexius> YOU'LL DOOM US ALL!</b>~shadow-stike has left the chatroom<b><Alexius> SHADOW-STRIKE WAS THE ONLY OBEDIENT ONE HERE.<Alexius> EITHER THAT OR THE THUNDER CLOUDS CAME TO THEM AND BROKE THEIR CONNECTION LIKE THEY DID TO</b> ALEXIUSS <b>FROM THE FUTURE.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Dexevara asks "Do you have a personal favorite character from RA and why?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> I like them all.<alexiuss> I wish I could draw all of them more. I am very sad that I can't. Not until January anyway.<b><Alexius> ALL CONVENTIONS END IN JANUARY AND A GLORIOUS STUDIO WILL BE CONSTRUCTED OUT OF THEIR ASHES.<Alexius> WHERE AN RA MOVIE-SHOW WILL BE FILMED.<Alexius> AND WILL BE POSTED ON YOUTUBES FOR ALL LIFE-FORMS TO SHARE AND ENJOY.<Alexius> SHARE AND ENJOY!</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Rav3nHat asks "What bra size is zee captain?"
</h4>

<p><b><Alexius> (SLAPS RAV3NHAT FOR ASKING INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS.)</b><alexiuss> Captain is ALL bra sizes!<b><Alexius> CAPTAIN IS EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE EVERYWHERE.<Alexius> CAPTAIN IS THE EMBODIMENT OF HUMANITY.<Alexius> COMPRESSED INTO ONE, DUE TO THE APOCALYPTIC EVENTS.<Alexius> OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.<Alexius> WRITE YOUR OWN GUESSES IN YOUR FANFICTIONS.<Alexius> BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA, BEING FROM THE PAST AND ALL.</b></p>

<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Zaifon asks "Do you have a story already planned for the future?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> The story is planned years ahead.<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Hawkpath-tail asks "Is Lifalope gonna follow Snippy and the minions around, or will it just go around the earth, bringing life?"
</h4>

<b><Alexius> I DON'T FREAKING KNOW. WHAT DID I JUST SAY ABOUT BEING FROM THE PAST<Alexius> WHAT THE HELL WOULD LIFALOPE DO WITH THEM? DANCE IN THE SUNSHINE? HEAL ALL THEIR WOUNDS? SAVE THEM FROM CERTAIN DOOM? WHAT KIND OF BORING STORY IS THAT?*THROWS A SHOE</b><alexiuss> (Dodges shoe thrown in my direction)<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~rocking-cupcake asks "What do you do when you have artist's block?"</h4>


<alexiuss> I don't have artists' block.<b><Alexius> WHAT I HAVE IS A BLOCK OF TIREDNESS OR SICKNESS!<Alexius> IF I HAVE A VIRAL INFECTION WHICH IS EATING MY ORGANS I AM UNABLE TO DRAW.<Alexius> IF I SPEND TOO MUCH TIME AT EXHIBITIONS MY ARMS BECOME LIMP LIKE NOODLES AND I AM UNABLE TO DRAW. I AM ONLY ABLE TO FLAIL ARMS IN GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE TABLET, SCREAMING WILDLY AT IT "WHY WON'T YOU DRAW YOURSELF?"</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~ZhonLord asks "Alexiuss, where did you get the idea to give Zee Captain such incredible luck? Was there any particular inspiration behind it, or did it just sound fun?
</h4>


<alexiuss> Do you personally believe that captain has incredible luck? Because Snippy wouldn't think so. It's all a matter of perspective.<alexiuss> And speculation.<alexiuss> Does captain even exist? Perhaps Captain is just a figment of Snippy's mind which he created to cling to harsh reality of post-apocalyptic survival. Someone to talk to.<alexiuss> Someone invincible and lucky.<alexiuss> Someone who is everyone he remembers who are now gone due to the destruction of his home.<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~sargemav352 asks "Will we be learning more about the pilot's history and about who he is or was?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Yes. ALL the character back stories will be expanded upon once I have more time.<alexiuss> I am planning to publish a book.<alexiuss> With words!<alexiuss> I don't know what to call this book yet.<alexiuss> Perhaps "The Horrible Life of Mr. Snippy."<alexiuss> Anyhow, it will be a novel (not a comic) which will dig deep into each of the character's back stories and factoids of interest.<alexiuss> It will be posted on deviantart, chapter by chapter for all to read!<alexiuss> And to contribute towards!<alexiuss> If your fanfiction is awesome enough, you can be part of this book too!<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp>: ~Zaifon asks "How do you select your colour scheme? Do you use a reference or have a colours known to man learned by heart?"
</h4>

<b><Alexius> <Alexius> I START IN BLACK AND WHITE.<Alexius> COLORS ARE SLAPPED ON LATER AT RANDOMLY.<Alexius> WHATEVER COLORS FEEL BEST.<Alexius> I OPERATE ON FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELINGS.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Jayem13 asks "Do you read books? If so, what is your favorite book?" and ~rocking-cupcake asks "What was your favorite comic growing up?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Favourite book is "Roadside Picnic."<alexiuss> I read 300 words a minute so I eat tons of books.<alexiuss> Om nom nom.<b><Alexius> THIS INTERVIEW WILL END IN 5.8 MINUTES.<Alexius> THE SINGULARITY IS COLLAPSING.<Alexius> POST QUESTIONS FASTER.<Alexius> POST ALL OF THEM NOW.<Alexius> THIS IS THE END.<Alexius> THE END IS COMING.</b><alexiuss> My favourite comic growing up was "Robocop."<alexiuss> And a few Russian ones whose names I don't remember due to me reading them so much that the covers fell off.<alexiuss> "Starhammer" was also an awesome sci-fi book that I read at least 10 times.<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Keilythefox asks "If you had to be stuck with one of your characters for the rest of eternity, which one would you want? Which one would you actually get stuck with?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> I would prefer to be stuck with Snippy!<b><Alexius> I CHOOSE CAPTAIN, BECAUSE ONLY CAPTAIN CAN TURN ETERNITY INTO A "TERNITY" OR EVEN INTO A DELICIOUS TURNIP DUE TO... SYSTEM ERROR.</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Vamperator asks "I know RA is a big part of your place in this World, but I really want to see your other Art more. Are you planning on creating something non-RA, or, do I dare to say it, make another comic-esque series?"
</h4>

<b><Alexius> 3 MINUTES.</b><alexiuss> Making more series is improbable.<alexiuss> RA is too much fun right now.<alexiuss> Unless my life changes dramatically.<alexiuss> RA will be my main focus.<b><Alexius> 1 MINUTE.<Alexius> ARHGHHH!</b><h4>
thefluffyshrimp> ~Zaifon asks "Alexiuss, how have manage to keep RA going for such a long time without losing your mind?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> I take breaks thanks to conventions!<b><Alexius> WHO'S TO SAY THAT THE MIND IS FOUND?<Alexius> MAYBE IT IS LOST.<Alexius> LOST FOREVER.<Alexius> 30 SECONDS!</b><h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> ~Flekker asks "How many times did you re-design the characters appearances before you found something you liked?
</h4>


<alexiuss> Only once.<alexiuss> Snippy was redesigned once.<alexiuss> Because on first attempt he was too difficult to draw.<alexiuss> That was the only character that was re-designed.<h4>
<thefluffyshrimp> LAST ONE: ~TheOneWhoLovesToEat asks "Do you secretly have dirty thoughts about Photoshop?"
</h4>


<alexiuss> Photoshop the computer program? Maybe.<alexiuss> Photoshop the worm from RA, no.<b><Alexius> 15 SECONDS.</b><h4>
