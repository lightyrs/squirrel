BC: "We played our first Lightning Bolt show as aduo in December of '94. And then a month later we got a singer,Hisham, and so the second show was as a trio, and that went on fora year and a half. We were all at Rhode Island School ofDesign..."
BG: "Fun stuff (laughs)."
BC: "I was a junior, I was drumming with this guitarist and welost our bass player, so Brian was a new freshman, and we heardthis new freshman was really good at bass. So we played a few timeswith him and it didn't gel very well, so we sort of stopped. But Istopped playing with the guitarist and so the next semester me andBrian tried it out again, just the two of us. I don't even know ifwe were looking for a guitarist..."
BG: "We played once with Dare, who was a guitarist, which wasok, but we decided to do it as just the two of us."
BC: "Did we know Godhead Silo back then? I'm sure I heard Ruinsand Godhead Silo, the two bass/drums bands which introduced us tothe fact that we could get away with just being bass and drums. Hehad just one cabinet, and it just seemed so loud at the time(laughs)."
BG: "I had a 15" aluminum cone Hartke speaker combo amp (has 4speakers now)."
BC: "And I had probably the same drum set. I'd been playingdrums all through high school, and had come to college and playedin a few little bands, I was really into playing drums, I played asmuch as I could.."
BC: "Our first show I think we played one really tight song(sings the riff), one really loose song (vocalizes the rhythm) andtwo others just whatever... so it was pretty loose.."
BG: "We probably have all that stuff on tape."
BC: "(points at wall of cassettes) This is all... we've beenfour-tracking everything from the start. So, everything (laughs)some of it's really good. I have our first show, up there. Thenwhen Hisham joined, we were still pretty loose, and we saw Le SavvyFav play their first show - they were another RISD band, with somesuccess, and they were really poppy and tight, and we were like"holy shit, we gotta write songs!" So we ran back, that same night,we ran out of the show and recorded like (sings drum part). So thenwe came up with like a whole eight or nine song set with Hisham, itwas all real tight. We kinda went full u-turn from our first 3-6months, a year and a half of not much improvisation. And we've kindof ping ponged around since then. For our first record (Yellow), werecorded five songs, and then ditched four of them and put on stuffoff the four-track that we liked, that sounded more interesting tous. And kept like one tight song for that record I think. Hishamwas singing with delay and effects and stuff, and he was playingdrums a little bit. We went into a studio and recorded all thatstuff, at Brown University, this kid recorded us... I don't know,some of that stuff's alright, but... some of that stuff's not...alright."[page break]
BG: "It had like a funk element... I hadn't started looking ateffects yet, and thinking about my tone, the way I sound... I wasreally just into being a good bass player, I didn't really thinkmuch more about what kind of sounds I could get. It just soundedreal funky, I thought. I was slapping... but it was also reallydark and noisy in this really nice way. And you were playing with atribal... you were slower and more heavy."
BC: "Yeah, I don't know what I was listening to, Neurosis, orthe Unsane, I really liked the early Unsane, and Crash Worship, thefour drummer band, I was into that stuff, at that point.Caveman-ish punk/metal."
BG: "(two handed tapping) (laughs) Pretty much that came fromjust noodling around, pretty much. I do all that stuff on the banjostring. I was pretty dorky when I was in high school, I was doing alot of Billy Sheehan stuff."
BG: "I was listening to a lot of Philip Glass stuff and when Iwas playing bass I was trying to do a lot of finger-tappingarpeggios that were really repetitive. I was into the way thatstuff sounded, even though it was orchestral. But that song "TheFaire Folk" (Ride the Skies) definitely has that Philip Glass... Imean, it's totally different."
BC: "I didn't know you were listening to Philip Glass - it allmakes sense now (laughs)."
BG: "I don't seek out my own music very well, I just getinfluenced by friends who play me stuff..."
BC: "Hisham would go back to Japan for the summers, andsometimes the winter parts, and we would just play the two of us atthose points, we spent more time doing that, at some point, thanplaying as a three-some."
BG: "I remember fall of 98, which was my senior year, having mylast practice with those guys."
BC:(BC gets on ladder to get poster for first Clutters show)"When they very first started, I was playing drums with them, itwas like a metal band, or hardcore, thrash."
BC: "Their first 7 inch was basically that same stuff."
BG: Yeah they kept doing that for a little bit. Then Hisham tookover and I quit cause Lightning Bolt... I couldn't really handlepracticing with both bands and being in school it was too muchstuff
BC: Fort Thunder started in September of 95 so we werepracticing at the school for almost a year, and then we moved toFort Thunder, which was a bigger space than all of this and thatwent until 2001. We were practicing there the whole time, and weboth lived there some.."[page break]
BC: "First record came out in 98. It took us a long time. Thefirst two years kinda just got shelved. After Hisham left we wantedto start fresh, so in a weird way it was like we just started againin 96 or 97. We did a 7 inch in 97 split with Forcefield. We justwent through a lot of songs, and the idea of recording records andstuff didn't really occur to us for a while, we were just playing.We probably had a lot of notoriety in this town way before we everhad a record, we had already gone through multiple sets, songshows, improvised shows. Until Ben showed up and said hey do youguys want to do a record. We went around the country in 97, fiveweeks, playing like ten shows (laughs), lost shitloads of money,drove around... it was one of those kinds of tours you'd never everdo again, the country was just like this great adventure, justdriving down the road was the most thrilling thing. So playing oneshow every five days and just driving around, but yeah, didn'treally work financially. We've toured every year since then.."
BG: "Back then it was way more haphazard. We hadn't come up witha principle like... let's have a bunch of songs that we play. Whenwe went on tour in 97 we played that one song for like the firstfifteen minutes of our set.."
BC: "We played this one riff - we tried to play it for twentyminutes but it would probably end up being like ten, we did somerecordings of it where it was twenty minutes. And then we playedthat (sings drum part) which just got ditched of which we have an 8track recording somewhere, and then we had a space forimprovisation. And then I think we had something else which wassort of improvised but we sort of knew what was going on. So it wasalmost half and half. We played so much around town. There wasbands like Landed, they were doing this thing where every show theywould have a brand new set, and they would play once or twice amonth - even whole new instrumentation, even. Same people, orsometimes they'd have some other people, but that was a new thing,for a lot of people in town, and I think we got caught up in thatsort of thing. Cause I remember trying to get new shit for everyshow, playing some shows where we'd have one, two-part riffy thingand then make up two-thirds of the set there. But it was realsimple improvising, repetition, we'd just seek out the most simplething we could seek out and then just beat it to death... that wasthe early days. We just play and play, and tape it, and then listenback to what we're doing."
BG: "If I come up with a riff on my own, which I used to try alot more, but I've sort of given up because the way he plays drumsI have to come up with riffs that are built around his beats, andusually I can't imagine that when I'm playing by myself, cause he'sgot his own accents and stuff.."
BC: "Even 'Bizarroland', this kind of arpeggiated thing."
BC: "Sometimes you come in with stuff that has these weird timechanges and I'm just like "What?" It's way more proggy 'CaptainCaveman'."
BG: "Cause it's so much distortion and bi-amped all this sub-lowcoming out of the 18s, anything I do has so much force, it's reallynice. I do think that's such an important thing, that's the problemwith most bands that I see, is actually getting your equipment tosound good live. It just seems like people neglect that, and theythink way more about what they're playing and what's happening inthe song, in theory, but I think the reality of it is that peopleare gonna be just hearing something initially that's purely sonicand either sounds when it hits you or it doesn't. It's funny causeI feel like we're a really un-dynamic band... but there's a fewmoments where there's a dynamic thing that happens so it reallystands out but we're not very dynamic (laughs) it's for the mostpart all one volume, full volume. We've gotten better at going fromhigh parts to low parts or switching certain things compositionallyso it always feels like the changes are dramatic - on my end.."
BC: "It's pretty easy to sound sort of dynamic too when there'sonly two of you. We can fake changes all the time.."
BG: "when you have more people in the band, the guitar can stopbut the bass can keep going, the bass player can stop, the drummercan play by himself, there's so many more dynamic options than whatwe have."
BC: "There's only a certain range of ploys we can use to... It'slike nine minutes, the second, two thirds of it is like high sonicdelay stuff, really pretty."
BG: "I felt more comfortable sounding like metal, letting alittle bit of that stuff into what I'm doing. Especially just thesound, I turned up the midrange a lot, and I've been doing thatlately, I just think it sounds more... aggressive. But it soundslike shredding guitar more, but I'm kinda getting into it, cause itactually works, it sounds more mean, more intense.."
BC: "You actually used to be against sounding mean."
BG: "Yeah I still feel that way... I don't wanna have a rule.There's just certain types of mean where you just instantly getlumped in to something... I felt like we needed to be pushing tothe next level. But that's kind of why we've been so quirky and...vague for a while too.."
BC: "It's less quirky and less playful, to some extent, thansome of our other stuff. [Yoko Ono's "Greenfield Morning"] Ihaven't heard it... but I'm sure I've heard something, by somebody,who has heard it (laughs) that I've since picked up. The new albumhas live delay on it, for the first time. He got a delay pedal andI got the same thing, for my vocals. There's less squirrelly,chipmunk singing. It's a darker world than 1998. The first, yellowrecord was half four track, quarter 8 track and a quarter justwalkman. And then the second one was half inch tape in a studio,Wonderful Rainbow was two different two inch studios. The new onewas half two inch 8 track and half here, live to two track DAT.[page break]So we played in that room and our friend DaveAuchenbach sat here, with his DAT machine and did live mixing buthe couldn't hear what the hell he was doing cause we were so loudover there. Half the new one was really press record and play. Wedid 13 takes of the first song, 10, 11 takes of #5 . We did somerecording in my old place a year and a half ago, we did about 11 or12 hours of improv, where he was in the other room doing livemixing to a quarter inch two track machine. We wanted to repeatthat process, but it was more difficult not improvising but tryingto play songs, we had an idea of how they're supposed to sound, itwas kind of chaos, and it was grueling. Some of the best stuff isthe stuff we recorded on the DAT machine. We wanted to lay down oursongs and then just improvise stuff. We screwed up, didn't scheduleenough time in the studio, so we really only had like five daysthere, and the sound was a little strange for our volume. So we didthat stuff, and thought about it for a couple of days and decidedno, we need to subsidize it with more stuff, so then we came inhere for two and a half weeks, every day. Song 3 & 4 we justmade up in the studio, and the final fifteen minutes or so of therecord is stuff we just made up here. I think some improvised stuffhas snuck into every album, but this one has more, and it'sfeatured more. That's what we were kind of shooting for the wholetime, in a way. It's sort of the most obnoxious stuff. Buthopefully that will be a bridge to new stuff. We've being doingsessions like that we've improvised, and had Dave kind of mixing onthe fly, sort of trying to destroy the mix and save the mix all atthe same time. We haven't really played the craziest stuff live.Cause a lot of it was so dependent on the mix. But the new album ispretty much our live set. We did three and half weeks to warm upfor the recording, with just that new stuff. We played three oldsongs at the end of the set. Everyone had the same exuberance, forthe most part.."
BG: "The music isn't a problem except it can drive some peopleto be aggressive, and then that person will bum other people outbecause it gets too male, aggressive."
BC: "There's definitely a bigger audience now, our initialaudience was our friends, and it grew to our friends and people inother cities who could have been our friends who we didn't reallyknow yet, and now it's grown to all those other people (laughs).Not to insult our audience. We did the SPIN article, which weargued about, we didn't want to do it, It seems like one of theexciting things about playing music is you're almost introducingyourself to people, like a big loud "Hello" this is who I am. Soyour introducing your music to this whole new set of people, with aSPIN article or whatever, and it's like, I don't know if they'repeople I really want to meet. I don't know, maybe I'm just being ajerk. People identify with us who maybe a) have a lot of energy,basically, football teams are going to show up at some point, andidentify with something. But not everything, and I think there'senough elements to keep them away. We're a fringe element ofpopular rock music, we're not gonna change our aesthetic as a liveband, which going to limit our popularity... I guess. We're notchanging our recording technique to emphasive the more conservativeelements of our music or something, so it seems like we'll safelystay on the fringe.."
BG: "But I hope our music changes. Who knows, I'm not gonnapredict what it'll be like.."[page break]
BC: "We've been playing the stuff on the new album for the lasttwo years. The last stuff we did was probably our most poppy andour most obnoxiously dissonant, the easiest and harshest listeningstuff. I don't know if we did that in reaction to what we alreadyhad, to form a well rounded thing, or if we're just getting moreand more schizophrenic, which may be the case.."
BG: "We had a couple of shows in England."
BC: "We just get stuck sometimes in really big rooms, eventhough we try to stress to people that we want smaller rooms. Andit seems like if we're gonna say yes to something in a bigger roomwe should kinda be prepared to deal with more people. And then Ithought that maybe that (using video) was a way to do it. Have acamera project what's happening in front so people in the back canget a sense ."
BG: "The only other band that made me think that might be whatwe're like is seeing Friends Forever in NY, when they played thatPolish place and they were playing on the street. Part of what Irealized is that it's really exciting to not know what's going on,to hear something happening but not getting all the information,and knowing that you could fight your way to get it, but you'regetting all these different kinds of information, you're gettingall these people's reactions, you're seeing that people are goingcrazy in front, when they were playing there was smoke andfireworks and stuff which also added a lot, and they play out oftheir van, you could see their van shaking. You're getting all thisdifferent information than what you would typically get at ashow.
BC: It's so fun, to be watching a band and just sitting downthere waiting, and just knowing... if you're playing onstage andthe band stops and they take their stuff down and then you bringyour stuff up and then you get ready to go, but to have your stuffready to go and a lot of times I'll be standing there watching theother band, it just allows my personal momentum to really build upso you're so ready to go. That doesn't always work. We play in someof these places now where there are so many people packed in therewe can't even set up our stuff on the floor, there's not enoughroom. Which again is, if we took a firmer grip on not allowing somany people in the club or whatever, there's ways to put our footdown, but we're not exactly a putting our foot down kind of band. Ido wonder if it's a bummer sometimes. I've been at the back ofrooms at floor shows, you can't see it, everyone's muffling it tosome extent, doesn't sound as good... I wonder if it's going to bumout more people than it makes happy.."
BG: "It might bum people out in a really obvious way but itmight excite people in a really not-obvious way. It might notalways be the best way, but it's just different and it works.."
BC: "We've carved out our own set of memories for people, maybeit's just a marketing plan, man, like you remember the LightningBolt show cause of that aspect.."
BC: "In Providence, there's been shows for years and years whereeverybody plays on the floor, in different areas. At Fort Thunderthat was something we just did, a band would play in this room andthen a band would play in that room, there weren't stages..."
BC: "Mat Brinkman is from Curville TX, which is outside ofAustin, (in 97) we played in Austin and then we pulled intoCurville for a couple of days cause we had nothing to do, andChurch's Chicken had this weird stage in the parking lot where hehad seen bands when he was a kid play. So we called them up andsaid we were local bands and they said yeah, come on down and play.So Forcefield and Lightning Bolt played a show to two kids whowalked out of the park, and one fifty year old dude walked out ofthe woods, and the last thing he had heard was Jimi Hendrix, he wasblown away by us (laughs). On this last tour in Baltimore, the clubTalking Head, we were set up to play there and it got really packedreally fast, so we set up in the alley in the back. We played backthere and a light rain was falling, and then the cops eventuallyshowed up after about 25 minutes."
BG: "That show was amazing because of the threat of the rain andthe threat of the police."
BC: "But we made it, we got through all the rock, we didn'tquite get to the abrasive psychedelic stuff (laughs). The tourbefore that, in Seattle we played on the street, we showed up andthey had booked it in this tiny art gallery, and we could fit fortypeople in there, and a hundred people showed up so we playedoutside, which we can do because of our setup. And that lastedthirty minutes before the cops came, people come out of theircondos, people in trees. So that element is still there We don'thave a booking agent, we don't ask for guarantees. I just end upemailing some weird kid who has a weird plan and that's whathappens (laughs). ."
BC: "We did the Oops tour which was organized by Skin Graft,Locust headlined, we played the whole thing and Arab on radarplayed the whole thing, Wolf Eyes, Orthrelm, Hella, Get Hustle,Blood Brothers all did sections of it. That's what that SPINarticle based its whole thing on. We did a month with USA is aMonster, it's good to go with a friend's band, I don't think it'sgood to go with a package tour. It's too much of the same thing andyou don't get to meet any local bands or anything. We have a lot ofsimilarities with that band that's playing tonight, USA and I'mtotally fine with it cause I think they're a great band. But theSPIN Article lumping us in with Mars Volta who I've never listenedto..."
BG: "I always get the sense that people want to believe thatthere's something happening or there's something big that'shappening, there's all these bands that kind of have the sameagenda or there's some kind of specific point of view that emergingthat's going to change everything... whenever bands get lumpedtogether I always feel like they make it seem like all thesedifferent musicians have some kind of cohesive idea and they'reworking together to change things, I don't like that stuff. [OldTyme Lemonade] it's a real dark side of Providence comp this guyput out, who's on tour with Wolf Eyes now. Providence has been arich, lively place... it had good bands when I moved here in 91, Ifeel like Fort Thunder kinda ushered in or coincided with a bit ofa heyday, where the art school really met the local scene, that wasthe first time that the snobbery between the two broke down andpeople started interacting. And it's kind of been lively eversince, there's always new stuff. The venues come and go, and whenyou have a good venue you feel like there's more bands. We're in abit of a dark period now with venues there's been some thingsclosing, and evictions, and this and that.."[page break]
BC: "50% musicans 50% artists. Which is kind of a pain in theass, I feel like I'm kinda doing both, instead of fully doinganything. And for some reason Lightning Bolt seems more fullyrealized than almost anything else for me.."
BG: "Lightning Bolt does seem like something that ties ustogether in kind of a cool way. I think we're both visually intomaking little worlds, little places that have their own reality,their own rules and stuff... cause its really hard to figure outexactly what we're doing when we're playing Lightning Bolt, wedon't really talk about it, and when we try to we always just getconfused.."
BC: "But it's pretty grounded in reality. That's what makesLightning Bolt powerful, it's taken us who are pretty fantasyoriented characters and shoved us into this thing that has to dealwith people... It's fantasy that can have a real instant impact onreality. But we do live in our kind of dream worlds. Providence,one of its great things is that it's always been a cheap place tolive we can afford a room to practice in, play as loud as we want,not share it, spread out, have our own places to make... itpromotes fantasy world living to some extent. ... In the beginningit was more music than art, but now it's more art than music. FortThunder was like fantasy world headquarters for us, and it was aslap in the face when we all got kicked out, and it became anunused parking lot for Staples (laughs), extra parking lot for aStaples that nobody even goes to anymore. I think the Boredoms hada big impact on my art, and Fort Thunder, like Eye as an artist.Not to give him credit for everything but that was definitelysomething that people were listening to way back. It was just likeholy shit, they're dressed up in these weird suits and they'regoing nuts! That was the origins of dressing up in weird suits. Ialso think Pee Wee's Playhouse, Gary Panters sets... I know thathad an influence on Mat. We went to Gary's studio to see the shadowplay, I went to sign the book and Art Spiegelman was the guy rightbefore me, I was like whoah! To me he's almost like a mythologicalcomic book character. He was playing Forcefield stuff..."
BC: "I'm really excited about it, because I feel it's the firstone to capture the live experience closer, I think, but maybe I'mwrong, it has more of a streamlined energy through the whole thing,the other ones felt more processed, less naturalistic. They're morebeautiful, the new one feel rawer and more harsh. Maybe it's thatkind of thing which I think happens to all bands, which is youfinally reach your vision, and nobody likes it (laughs), they justlike your mistakes, you know? That's kind of how it's designed, itkind of lures you in under false pretenses that it's going to moreof the same, and then it sticks you with these 9 and 10 minutesongs, that you just have to sit there for, whether you like it ornot. Which is kind of how our sets have been lately. It's weird tobe a band, we've been a band for ten years now, which for somepeople is nothing. We've gone through a lot of errors even betweenWonderful Rainbow and the new album, we had fairly worked out setsthat we ditched because we forgot it or (laughs)."
BG: "Sometimes we get excited about stuff in the practice spaceand we play it live and it doesn't stick, for some reason..."
BC: "We're kind of slow. We're just not going to fall for any ofthe pacing that bands are supposed to deal with, cause freshness isthe most important thing. If someone says you gotta do 10interviews we'll be like no, we're gonna do one."
BG: "Music doesn't take that long to do, even if you practiceevery day, for us it's like an hour out of the day, but it doestake a lot of energy..."
BC: "We'll play and then listen to what we played that night andtry and learn something for the next night, and then it turns intotwo hours... I was reading the Sun Ra biography, where he's doing14 hours a day between the practicing and the writing. I read thatand I was utterly inspired - but then reality kicks in. For medrawing is important, meditation as much as drumming, riding mybike, trying to figure out how to pay next month's rent factors inthere as well... between all that, we do as much as we can..."
BC: "Mindflayer's me and Mat, we've been roommatessince freshman year of college, 91, we met in the dorms, then westarted Fort Thunder together, so Mindflayer's always been thisweird extension of me and him, it's drums and electronics, it'sgenerally all improvisational."
