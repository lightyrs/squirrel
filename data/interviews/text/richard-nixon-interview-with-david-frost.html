I must say I sort of cracked up. Started to cry, pushed my chair back. And then I blurted it out. And I said, I'm sorry; I just hope I haven't let you down.</p>

Highlights from the historic David Frost encounters with Richard Nixon in 1977. </p>

<p><strong>[Sir David Paradine Frost, (7 April 1939 â 31 August 2013) ]</strong>
I've interviewed Richard Nixon once before the Nixon interviews in 1977. That was back in 1968 when he was candidate Nixon. And the scene of his interview was his campaign HQ in New York. In fact, we arrived slightly ahead of the furniture, but we managed to wrestle up a couple of chairs and we were very soon discussing his notorious you won't have Richard Nixon to kick around anymore speech back in 1962. </p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
As a public figure, I would say that was a mistake. And I can also assure you that as far as getting into an argument with press it won't happen again, as long as I'm a public figure. </p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong>
Well that was one campaign pledge he was certainly not able to fulfill, within two years he was at war with the press over Vietnam, and within 4 years over Watergate. We'll come back to the unfolding drama of Watergate later in the program. But right now, we turn to a question that I asked him that has an extraordinary resonance this week. </p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong>
And did you in a sense feel that resignation was worse than death? </p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
In some ways. I didn't feel it in terms that the popular mythologists about this era write, that resignation is so terrible, I better go out and fall on a sword or take a gun and shoot myself or this or that or the other thing. I wasn't about to do that. I never think in those terms; suicidal terms, death wish and all that, that's all just bunk. But on the other hand, I feel myself that life without purpose, I feel that life in which an individual has to â is forced to go against his intuitions about what he thinks he ought to do, that life then becomes almost unbearable. And so resignation meant life without purpose as far as I was concerned. I had nothing more to contribute to the causes I so deeply believed in. And also I felt that resignation meant that I would be in a position of â of not having really anything to live for, and related to the fact that it is life without purpose, not having anything to life for that it could be a very very shattering experience which it has been and it to a certain extent it still is. </p>

<p>You see people â the average person and I understand this, I'm â I do not consider myself to be other than an average person, none of us should really. We all think we're a little smarter than we are. But you feel that: Gee, isn't it just great to, you know, to have enough money to afford to live in a very nice house and to be able to play golf. And to have nice parties and to wear good clothes, shoes and suits, ect. ect. ect. or travel if you want to. And the answer is if you don't have those things, then they can mean a great deal to you, when you do have them, they mean nothing to you. </p>

<p>To me, the unhappiest people of the world are those in the watering-places, the international watering-places, like the south coast of France, and Newport, Palm Springs and Palm Beach, going to parties every night, playing golf every afternoon, then bridge. Drinking too much, talking too much, thinking too little. Retired. No purpose.</p>

<p>And so, well, I know there are those who will totally disagree with this and say "Gee, boy, if I could just be a millionaire, that would be the most wonderful thing; if I could just not have to work every day, if I could just be out fishing or hunting, or playing golf, or traveling, that would be the most wonderful life in the world". They don't know life, because what makes life mean something is purpose. A goal. The battle. The struggle. Even if you don't win it. I know a lot of people and I can understand it; say: "Gee wiz, it just isn't fair". You know for an individual to be get off of a pardon simply because he happens to be President, when another individual goes to trail and maybe has to serve a prison sentence for it. I can understand how they feel. I can only say that no one in the world, no one in our history, could know how I felt. No one could know how it feels to resign The Presidency of the United States. Is that punishment enough? Oh probably not. But whether it is or isn't as I have said earlier in our interview we have to live with not only the past but for the future, and I don't know what the future brings but whatever it brings I'll still be fighting. </p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
Richard Nixon there talking about resignation and death and in the process revealing quite a bit of his philosophy of life. The Nixon interviews took place in March 1977, 28 and 3 1/4 hours in all. Over 12 days spread over a period of a month just up the coast from San Clemente. Richard Nixon didn't know any of the question in advance. Indeed, nor did he see the edited programs until they were broadcast. After they had aired, he did describe them as 'tough but fair'. We begin right now with the subject of foreign policy. For almost 20 years now Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger have conducted a sort of contest to try to claim the credit for the best parts of Nixon's foreign policy. They're allies and accomplices obviously they couldn't attack one another openly but they had other techniques. Here for instance is Richard Nixon's in preyed of Henry Kissinger or sort of. </p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
Ah, I'm a fatalist, basically. Ah,Kissinger is more, despite his enormous intellectual capabilities, ah, one who, ah, ah, is, ah, perhaps, ah, some what less fatalistic, and, ahâor determinist in his views. More emotional, interestingly enough. Ah, although, I, too, have emotions. I tend to hide them perhaps more than he does, or submerge them, or suppress them, ah, but, ah, be that as it may we won't try to psychoanalyze each other at the moment. </p>

<p>But Kissinger, I will remember, after we went into Cambodia. He was for going in, ah, but here â I made a decision on the spot which we had not discussed before. He wondered about it at the time, but he totally supported it once it was made. We went to the Pentagon, and the day after the first movement into two sanctuaries and I asked the people at the Pentagon how many there were, and they said there were six. And, I said, "Well let's move into all of them." I remember Westmoreland raised the point that he didn't know whether or, not we could even handle two.</p>

<p>However; the other chiefs and the rest felt maybe we could handle all of them, particularly with the way the, ah, South Vietnamese, in the early days were fighting. So, right then, the decision was made to go into six, and it was one of the best decisions we made. Then came Kent State, which was a terrible emotional shock to me, ah, and a very great shock to Kissinger. </p>

<p>And, of course, a torrent of abuse because the implication was that because we did Cambodia, three students were killed in Kent State â that one followed the other, although the student body president of Kent State pointed out when he came to see me at the White House that while the Kent State tragedy partly was due to the disagreement about the war, that long before the war there were other issues that were stirring people up. </p>

<p><strong>"http://Lybio.net

<p>But, I remember right after that. Henry came in one day and he said,"You know, I'm not sure 'that we should have gone into this Cambodian thing and perhaps now has come the time 'that we should shorten the time and get out a little sooner." Ah, 'he wasn't seriously considering it, but he says, "I think," and he used to always preface it by saying, "I must warn you, Mr. President, that the situation that I hear from my colleagues from the colleges and universities is very, very serious, and, ah, Cambodia is, it could have been a mistake." And, said, "Henry," I said, "We've done it. "I said: "Remember Lot's wife. Never look back." I don't know whether Henry had read the Old Testament or not, but I had, and he got the point. Henry and I often had a little joke, between us after that. Whenever he would come in and â say, "Well, I'm not sure we should have done this, or that,or the other thing." I would say, "Henry, remember Lot's wife." And,that would end the conversation. </p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
Richard Nixon on Henry Kissinger and in Nixon's account who do you think came out as a strong stable decisive leader? And who came out as a neurotic intellectual? Of course when he was talking about his triumphs in China and so on, Richard Nixon was very eloquent, he spoke well for instance about Zhou Enlai and Mao, here he talks about how well informed Zhou Enlai was.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
He used to speak for example, very glowingly of not what I have done as President or Vice President for that matter, but of the come back. To him and Mao also mentioned that, told me he'd read "Six Crises" and paid it rather nice compliment, you know it wasn't a bad book and that for Mao is high praise, but many event â what interested most about it was not the achievements, not the crises but the come back, the come back. But when you look at Mao and Zhou Enlai, and Hua and all the others, Mao and his generation and Zhou Enlai being part of the long march. You can see why a come back means so much more than inheriting the job or being elected to the job and getting it rather easily and then doing it. Because it is struggle that appeals to them. It's triumphing over adversity. It is climbing to the summit, not being on the summit.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong>
Struggle, adversity, climbing to the summit, as so often from Richard Nixon when he talks about other people, he often feel he is also talking about himself, but of course, the foreign policy of the Nixon administration wasn't only the big power triumphs, the big power wheeling and dealing, it was also the Vietnam war, Cambodia. And it was Richard Nixon's analysis of that particular war that led inextricable to the stockade mentality of the Nixon White House.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the philosophy of that is Henry Kissinger has just come back, he's talking to Nixon, he tells him about LÃª Äá»©c Thá», so this is Nixon saying what Kissinger said about LÃª Äá»©c Thá».</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
I remember Kissinger reporting on the last meeting, he had with LÃª Äá»©c Thá», before the announcement on January 23rd. It was on January 15th basically of 1973, he said LÃª Äá»©c Thá», said to him in a very resigned and at this time perhaps off head manner, not expecting that it would be quoted, but it is going to be now, he said "Well, we've decided that President Nixon is not going to be affected by the protest and that under the circumstances that we have no choice, but to make a settlement, he was right."</p>

<p>Now, I don't mean by that, that I was sitting there in the White House with plugs in my ears, not listening. Oh, I could hear even if had plugs in my ears, it was that loud at time, the people marching around. But the point is that on the other hand, I knew that in order to get the enemy to take us seriously abroad I had to have enough support at home that they could not feel â that they could win in Washington, but they could not win in the battle field.</p>

<p>[ ]:
Thus in Nixon's eyes Washington became another battle field in the Vietnam War. And the peace protests became unwitting or witting accomplices of the North Vietnamese. Enemy's lists with thousands of names on them were being compiled. The atmosphere in the nation's capital was not pleasant, it was mean.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
A paranoic attitude?</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong>
Yes.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon]</strong>
Yes, I know, I understand that and it gets back to the statement that I made, rather emotional statement the day I left office and I said, "don't hate other people because hatred destroys yourself". Yeah, I want to say here that I have a temper, I controlled it publically rather well, sometimes privately I blow off some steam, but also as I've indicated and this is very hard for people to believe, but I think you can believe it after our session a few hours ago.</p>

<p>My weaknesses is perhaps where personal factors are concerned. Let's take the Kennedy's. Did you know that in eight years after Mrs. Nixon and I had served in Washington for eight years, Vice President, I was Vice President, she is my wife. We were never invited to the White House, for a dinner or for a lunch. I remember Rose Mary Woods, my secretary who made up the invitation list went out of her mind when I put Hubert Humphrey on the list for White House dinner, when I put for example, invited Jackie Kennedy and her two children to come up for a private dinner without any publicity, so they could see where their father and they had grown up and all the rest, when Mrs. Nixon had Rose Kennedy, okay that takes care of that â what I am trying to tell you that this whole business of â am I paranoid about hating people and trying to do them in and the answer is at times, yes, I get angry at people, but in human terms as far as I am concerned, I believe that an individual must never let hatred rule him.</p>

<p>I â Dolores Hope, Bob Hope's wonderful wife once said something to me, when she first came to California after the resignation, she said remember Dick, she said, "one person who loves you is worth ten who hates you" and so there is a love hate complex in all of us, and I just hoped that when they towed them all up, before you go to St. Peters or the other way down that maybe the ledger is going to come out reasonably well in that respect.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
You said in fact, in one of your speeches about taking responsibility for the climate in the White House and so on, and when you were talking about just then about we are people for us and against us, so I just remembered from somewhere memo of Bud Krogh's where he said, "those who are against us we will destroy in fact those who are not for us will destroy or something". There was this sort of extreme atmosphere abroad, this extreme climate abroad.</p>

<p><strong>"http://Lybio.net

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
The people that got us into the war. The brightest and the best prove to be the worst in this crisis because they could like [Rusk and Rusto]. At least have either supported or given us a change to get out of the war that they've gotten us into, but on the other hand they turn totally around, and they stirred up the demonstrators. </p>

<p>They couldn't possibly in my view â intelligent as they are have not understood that this kind of activity the divisivisim in America was making it very difficult for us to convince the North Vietnamese they have to negotiate. </p>

<p>Now that's why Henry Kissinger when you'd â you talk about this whole matter of leaks and so forth. And people think that maybe Kissinger went a little overboard at times on it. All that I did, but I'll never forget when the Cambodian leak occurred. </p>

<p>And we said Henry, it's possible, it might be somebody on your staff and Henry said I will destroy them. Now Henry is not a mean man, I mean, he's not one that is good after you know, his background knowing what the horrors, that we although really put repressive state the Hitler's Germany who is going to do that, but he says: "I will destroy them". </p>

<p>Why did we feel this way? We felt this way because the people on the other side were hypocritical, they were sanctimonious and they were not serving the best interest of the country. This is why, I must say Henry and I felt so strongly about it and call it paranoia, but paranoia for peace is not bad. I don't mean by that to suggest that everybody that was out talking against the war deliberately with intent was prolonging the war, but the effect of what they did was to prolong the war. Had it not been for the division in America the war would have been ended one to two years earlier it might be.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
And basically, what Elsberg really boils down to, I mean; the discrediting in all rest; what it boils down to. I didn't want to discredit the manners and I bet you I couldn't care less about the punk. I wanted to discredit that kind of activity which was despicable and damaging to the national interest.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
The wave of dissent lead to one of the most extraordinary inventions of the Nixon White House, the Houston plan. This advocated the systematic use of wiretapping, burglaries or black bag jobs as I'd call and infiltration of all sorts convert in every case in order to track down the dissenters. Houston explained to Nixon that part of this plan were definitely illegal.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
In retrospect it would have been better to do â to come back to crime legally rather than adding another crime to list?</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
But basically, the proposition you've just stated in theory is perfect, in practice it won't work. To get legislation, specific legislation, to have warrantless entries for the purpose of obtaining information and the rest, we are not only raised an out fly, but it would have made it terribly difficult to move in on these organizations because basically, they would be put on notice about the very fact of the legislation is on the books that they would be potential targets, and actions either going to be covert or not.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
So what in a sense you are saying is that there are certain situations and the Houston plan and that part of it was one of them where the president can decide that it's in the best interest in the nation or something and do something illegal.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
But when the President does it that means that it is not illegal.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
By definition? </p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Before we move on to Watergate, let's take a look at a variety of subjects briefer, clips, snapshots perhaps of Richard Nixon on a variety of issues.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
But we both want freedom of choice for all the world. We would both like a situation where there's no discrimination in voting. We were both like a situation where there is freedom of press and freedom of religion all over the world. We wouldn't both like situation where everything was perfect as it in Britain, as it is in America and we know very well it isn't perfect either place and it is never going to be because men are men and women are women and none of us are perfect. </p>

<p>Well, I should point out that in 1972, Chairman Mau had already suffered in my view a partial stroke. He attributed his inability to talk from Bronchitis, some of his staff did. But he was not in the best of health, then. </p>

<p>In 1976 and Juliet reported this to me when she returned there wasn't any question, but that his physical condition had rapidly deteriorated and then that he had a very, very short time to live. </p>

<p>He had to be helped to stand up for the handshake, but he was very proud that way. He was like Churchill. I remember the last time I saw Churchill. I went out to visit him and you probably know this house in London where he used to stay. And after we'd finished right they â Churchill at that time had a stroke was shortly before his death and he escorted me to the door afterwards. And his military aid tried to hang onto him to prop him up and he pushed him aside and just stood there by himself. I'd always stayed in clergies you know when I was out of office and consequently, it was well paid by clients. I could afford to stay there.</p>

<p>So I go up to my bedroom that day â after I'd had a long series of meetings and so forth and I go up to this marvelous room of course, the so called Kings Suite or Presidential Suite or maybe it was the Queen Suite. But there was no queen in it. But in any event, I go up to this room. Anyhow, I see five of Filipino Stewards bustling around, taken the bed out and put in another bed and I said, what are you doing. And they said, well we got your bed from the White House to put in here. </p>

<p>I why, who told you to do this, he said we always do this. I said that so that you will be more comfortable, you must always sleep in your bed, and you mean you brought this bed over in a plane. Well, I called in Don Hughes, my military aide and Bob Haldeman, and I chewed him out instantly. Well, my public temper is usually, fairly restrained. He is my old man rather than my mother's being, and he never swore and then but he could talk loud and I just quite exponentially deleted, is this all about. And I said but Mr. President you got to understand. I said you're going to be a very important meeting, and it has been the custom, apparently President Johnson had done it. Afford to bring a bed along, I said okay, here is an order. So I think it's one of the first ever, I said: get that bed out of here by tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the Soviet Union for example, when we wanted to have a completely private talk, we go and get in the car, and just sit in the car. </p>

<p>Now you say, but why couldn't you just take a walk. Well and this is no reflection in our Soviet friends, because I'm sure maybe the British used to do it. The French did look, we knew we were bugged in France until [indiscernible] came in and then got rid of a lot of it. But nevertheless is a common custom, but that is, you can't even walk by a plant or you can't stop and sit in a seat bench, without thinking, maybe there is a bug there. </p>

<p>So as a result, some of the most important decisions made in Moscow in Summit 1 and Summit 3, were made in that Presidential Limousine and where Kissinger [indiscernible] and I used to sit and talk about this and that the other thing.</p>

<p>In 1969, when I took over, I'll never forget that I went into the bathroom, which President Johnson had shown me when he took me around the White House. And there in the President's bathroom is a wall safe built into the wall. You can't tell that it's a safe you have to hit it, and then it opens and it's where the secret documents are kept.</p>

<p>When a President takes reading material over to the residence that is classified, and so that first night in the White House, after the inauguration parade and all the rest, I popped the door open.</p>

<p><strong>"http://Lybio.net
The Accurate Source To Find <a href="http://lybio.net">Transcript To</a> Nixon Interview With David Frost (4 of 6)."</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
It was the President's briefing for January the 20th, 1969. and as I looked at that briefing, the whole of Vietnam came into perspective, almost 300 a week had been killed, the year of 1968 President Johnson's last year in office. And the rate was at above 300 even then.</p>

<p>It's very difficult to be a king with no power. It's even more difficult I think perhaps to be a prince with no power. But in his case, the impression that he is was somewhat a shallow, callow, almost frivolous young fellow with hardly a thought in his head was totally dissipated. And what impressed me about him was first his total dignity. there was no sense of being ill at ease, even though he was considerably younger than I. Second his questions, he was very perceptive in answering his questions or asking his questions, I did the answering pretty much.</p>

<p>So all that I could say is this â someday he'll be king, he'll be a very good king, he'll be very intelligent, and people shouldn't think that he's just a dumb little wax and figure going through the motions that of kings without power, almost always do in Britain.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
And so to Watergate, the Watergate tapings took place over two days, the Wednesday and the Friday, the seventh and eighth days of taping. As we started to get into detail on the events of June and early July 1973, Richard Nixon seemed to look somewhat uncomfortable became somewhat hesitant. I moved on then to the whole subject of obstruction of justice in the period of June 23rd to July 5th.</p>

<p>And so I would have said it was a successful attempt to obstruct justice for that brief period.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
Now, just a moment, you're again making the case which of course is your responsibility as the attorney for the prosecution. Let me make the case as it should be made even if I were not the one who was involved for the defense. But the case for the defense here is this. You used the term obstruction of justice, you perhaps have not read the statute with regard to respect, obstruction of justice.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Okay.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
Obstruction, oh, I'm sorry. Of course, you probably have read it, but possibly you might have missed it, because when I read it, many years ago, perhaps when I was studying law, [if] although the statute didn't even exist then, because it's a relatively new statute as you know. But many event, when I read it even in recent times, I was not familiar with all of the implications of it. The statute doesn't require just an act. The statute has a specific prohibition; one must corruptly impede a judicial matter.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Well, a corrupt endeavor is enough.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
All right, a conduct endeavor, corrupt intent, but it must be corrupt and that gets to the point of motive. One must have a corrupt motive. Now I did not have a corrupt motive.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
My motive was pure political containment, and political containment is not a corrupt motive.</p>

<p>That first day's taping on Watergate. Lasted, for more than two hours, it was very much as Richard Nixon said that a question of prosecution and defense for instance. When we were talking about the John Dean meeting on March the 21st, 1974, Richard Nixon tried to maintain that mainly that meeting; he was rejecting clemency rather than talking about money, rather than talking about the hush money that had to be paid. I thought it was time to put the record straight and to quote some examples where he did discuss money, 16 examples in fact.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
12, but let's come back to the money, they were up on something else here, desperate to get away with the money, bored to death with the continual reference of the money, $1 million and so forth and so on. </p>

<p>Let me say that I think you could get that in cash, 13, that's why your immediate thing you've got no choice with 120 or whatever it is, right. 14, would you agree that this is a buy-time thing, you better damn well, get that done, but fast. 15. Now, who is going to talk to him, [Carlsen] 16, we have no choice and so on. Now reading as you've requested to thing in the whole thing in contextâ¦</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
Yeah, all right fine, let me just stop you right there, right there. You're doing something here, which I'm not doing and I will not do throughout this broadcast, you have every right to, you were reading there out of context, out of order, because I have read this and I know really better than you do.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
I'm sorry.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
And I should know it better, because I was there, and there's no reflection on you, you know it better than anybody else I know, so that way and you're doing it very well. But I am not going to sit here and read the thing back to you, I could have notes here, as you note, I participated on all of these broadcasts without a note in front of me, I've done it all from recollection, I may have made some mistakes. But not many.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
I never said this.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
It's your life we are talking about.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
The very last thing you read, do you ever have any choice with [tha]t. Why didn't you read the next sentence? Why did you leave it off?</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Carried on.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
No, no. The reason, the next sentence says, as I remember that so wrong. But you never have a choice with that. Do you ever have one? (Retoric) you never have a choice for that, because when you finally come down to it, it gets down to clemency. Now why after all of that horror story, and it was I mean even considering that, I mean much horrified people, why would you consider paying money for somebody who is blackmailing the White House, I've tried to give you my reasons, I was concerned about what he would do. But my point is, after that why not, why not you do, what was not done by Mr. Jaworski in his book, what was not done by Mr. George before the Senate Judiciary Committee, read the last sentence. The last sentence which says after that you never have any choice with that, because it finally comes down to clemency and I'd said six times in that conversation, you didn't read that in your ten â and six times, I said you can't provide clemency.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
The other point to be said is, here's Dean, talking about this hush money, the hunt, talking about blackmail and all of that â I would say that you endorse to ratify that, but let's leave one on one sided.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
I didn't endorse to retify.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Why didn't you stop it?</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
Because at that point, I had nothing to â no knowledge of the fact that it was going to be paid.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Richard Nixon's stonewall on that first day, turned out to be a disaster. Afterwards his aides were talking, and they said this was the one subject we couldn't discuss with him in advance; it was too personal. We didn't know what he was going to say. They felt he should have gone further, not just maintained a total stonewall.</p>

<p>On the second day of the Watergate taping, he arrived late; only time he arrived late, 17 minutes late. Poetically, it should have been 18.5, but it was 17, and he looked haggard. He looked like he did in the days the Watergate crisis. He'd obviously been reliving it for the past two days. And I soon sensed, he was prepared to go further, no more prosecution defense, almost father, confessor or something like that, and still he wouldn't go further than mistakes, and still I thought he had further to go and I thought he was more vulnerable by now, than he perhaps would ever be again in his life. So I felt I had to try and find a way of just pushing him, pushing him further.</p>

<p>Would you go further than mistakes that you've explained how you got caught up in this thing, you explained your motives, I don't want to quip by any of that, but just coming to the sheer substance, would you go further than mistakes â the word that seems not enough for people to understand.</p>

What word would you suggest?</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
My goodness, that's a â¦ I think that there are three things, since you asked me. I would like to hear you say â¦ I think the American people would like to hear you say â¦ One is: there was probably more than mistakes; there was wrongdoing, whether it was a crime or not; yes it may have been a crime too. Second: I did â and I'm saying this without questioning the motives â I did abuse the power I had as president, or not fulfil the totality of the oath of office. And third: I put the American people through two years of needless agony and I apologise for that. And I say that you've explained your motives, I think those are the categories. And I know how difficult it is for anyone, and most of all you, but I think that people need to hear it and I think unless you say it you are going to be haunted by it for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>I well remember when I let Haldeman and Erlichman know that they were to resign, that I had Ray Price [Nixon's speechwriter] bring in the final draft of the speech that I was to make the next night and I said to him, "Ray, if you think I ought to resign, put that in too, because I feel responsible." Even though I did not feel that I had engaged in these activities consciously in so far as the knowledge of, or participation in, the break-in, the approval of hush-money, the approval of clemency etc, there are various charges that have been made. Well, he didn't put it in, and I must say that at that time I seriously considered whether I shouldn't resign, but on the other hand I feel that I owe it to history, to point out that from that time on April 30, until I resigned on August 9, I did some things that were good for this country. We had the second and third summits. I think one of the major reasons I stayed in office, was my concern about keeping the China initiative, the Soviet initiative, the Vietnam fragile peace agreement and then an added dividend, the first breakthrough in moving toward â not love, but at least not war â in the Middle East. And, coming back to the whole point of whether I should have resigned then and how I feel now, let me say I didn't make mistakes in just this period; I think some of my mistakes that I regret most deeply came with the statements that I made afterwards. Some of those statements were misleading. I noticed, for example, the managing editor of the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, wrote, a couple, three months ago, as far as his newspaper was concerned: "We don't print the truth; we print what we know, we print what people tell us and this means that we print lies."</p>

<p>I would say that the statements that I made afterwards were, on the big issues, true â that I was not involved in the matters that I have spoken to â about; not involved in the break in; that I did not engage in, and participate in, or approve the payment of money, or the authorization of clemency, which of course were the essential elements of the cover-up â that was true. But, the statements were misleading exaggerating â in that enormous political attack I was under: it was a five-front war with a fifth column. I had a partisan senate committee staff, we had a partisan special prosecutors staff, we had a partisan media, we had a partisan judiciary committee staff, and a fifth column. Now under these circumstances, my reactions and some of these statements, and press conferences and so forth after that, I want to say right here and now, I said things that were not true. Most of them were fundamentally true on the big issues, but without going as far as I should have gone and saying perhaps that I had considered other things, but not done them. And for all those things I have a very deep regret.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
You mean â You got caught up in something and it snowballed?</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
It snowballed, and it was my fault. I'm not blaming anybody else. I'm simply saying to you that as far as I'm concerned, I not only regret it. I indicated my own beliefs in this matter when I resigned. People didn't think it was enough to admit mistakes; fine. If they want me to get down and grovel on the floor; no, never. Because I don't believe I should. </p>

<p>On the other hand there are some friends who say, "just face 'em down. There's a conspiracy to get you." There may have been. I don't know what the CIA had to do. Some of their shenanigans have yet to be told, according to a book I read recently. I don't know what was going on in some Republican, some Democratic circles as far as the so-called impeachment lobby was concerned. However, I don't go with the idea that there â¦ that what brought me down was a coup, a conspiracy etc. etc. etc. </p>

<p>I brought myself down. I gave them a sword, and they stuck it in and they twisted it with relish. And I guess if I had been in their position, I'd have done the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
What I'm really saying is that in addition to the untrue statements that you've mentioned. Um, could you just say with conviction, I mean not because I want you to say it, that you did do some covering up. We're not talking legalistically now; I just want the facts. You did do some covering up. But there was some time when you were overwhelmed by your loyalties or whatever else, but as you look tack that the record, you behaved partially protecting your friends, or maybe yourself. In fact you were, to put it at its most simple, part of a cover-up at times.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
No, I â I again â I again respectfully will not quibble with you about the use of the terms. However, before using the term I think it's very important for me to make clear what I did not do and what I did do and then I will answer your question quite directly. I did not in the first place commit a â the crime of obstruction of justice, because I did not have the motive required for the commission of that crime. The lawyers can argue that.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
We disagree on that.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
I did not commit, in my view, an impeachable offence. Now, the House has ruled overwhelmingly that I did. Of course, that was only an indictment, and it would have to be tried in the Senate. I might have won, I might have lost. But even if I had won in the Senate by a vote or two, I would have been crippled. And in any event, for six months the country couldn't afford having the president in the dock in the United States Senate. And there can never be an impeachment in the future in this country without a president voluntarily impeaching himself. I have impeached myself. That speaks for itself.</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
How do you mean "I have impeached myself"?</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
By resigning. That was a voluntary impeachment. And uh, now, what does that mean in terms of whether I â¦ you're wanting me to say that I participated in an illegal cover-up. No. Now when you come to the period, and this is the critical period, when you come to the period of March 21st on, when Dean gave his legal opinion, that certain things, actions taken by, Haldeman, Erlichman, [attorney general John] Mitchell et cetera, and even by himself amounted to illegal coverups and so forth, then I was in a very different position. </p>

<p><strong>"http://Lybio.net

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong>
And during that period, I will admit, that I started acting as lawyer for their defence. I will admit, that acting as lawyer for their defence, I was not prosecuting the case. I will admit that during that period, rather than acting primarily in my role as the chief and law enforcement officer of the United States of America, or at least with the responsibility for law enforcement, because the attorney general is the chief law enforcement officer, but as the one with the chief responsibility for seeing that the laws of the United States are enforced, that I did not meet that responsibility. And to the extent that I did not meet that responsibility, to the extent that within the law, and in some cases going right to the edge of the law in trying to advise Erlichman and Haldeman and all the rest as to how best to present their cases, because I thought that they were legally innocent, that I came to the edge. And under the circumstances I would have to say that a reasonable person could call that a cover-up. I didn't think of it as a cover-up. I didn't intend it to cover-up.</p>

<p>Let me say, if I intended to cover-up, believe me, I'd have done it. You know how I could have done it so easily. I could have done it immediately after the election simply by giving clemency to everybody. And the whole thing would had gone away. I couldn't do that because I said clemency was wrong. But now we come down to the key point and let me answer it in my own way about how I feel about the American people. I mean about whether I should have resigned earlier or what I should say to them now. </p>

<p>Well, that forces me to rationalise now and give you a carefully prepared and cropped statement. I didn't expect this question, frankly though, so I'm not going to give you that. But I can tell you this â¦</p>

<p><strong>[David Frost:]</strong>
Nor did I.</p>

<p><strong>[Richard Nixon:]</strong> <font>Source: LYBIO.net</font>
I can tell you this. I think I said it all in one of those moments that you're not thinking sometimes you say the things that are really in your heart. When you're thinking in advance and you say things that are, you know, tailored to the audience. I had a lot of difficult meetings in those last days before I resigned and the most difficult one, the only one where I broke into tears, frankly except for that very brief session with Erlichman up at Camp David, that was the first time I cried since Eisenhower died. </p>

<p>I met with all of my key supporters just the half-hour before going on television. For 25 minutes we all sat around the Oval Office, men that I had come to Congress with, Democrats and Republicans, about half and half. Wonderful men. And at the very end, after saying well thank you for all your support during these tough years, thank you for the â particularly for what you have done to help us end the draft, bring home the POWs, have a chance for building a generation of peace, which I could see the dream that I had possibly being shattered, and thank you for your friendship, little acts of friendship over the years, you know, you sort of remember with a birthday card and all the rest. </p>

<p>Then suddenly you haven't got much more to say and half the people around the table were crying. [ ] he was just shaking â sobbing. And I just can't stand seeing somebody else cry. And that ended it for me. And I just, well, I must say I sort of cracked up. Started to cry, pushed my chair back.</p>

<p>And then I blurted it out. And I said: "I'm sorry. I just hope I haven't let you down." Well, when I said: "I just hope I haven't let you down," that said it all. I had: I let down my friends, I let down the country, I let down our system of government and the dreams of all those young people that ought to get into government but will think it is all too corrupt and the rest. </p>

<p>Most of all I let down an opportunity I would have had for two and a half more years to proceed on great projects and programmes for building a lasting peace. Which has been my dream, as you know from our first interview in 1968 before I had any, when I thought I might win that year. I didn't tell you I didn't think I might not win that year, but I wasn't sure. Yep, I let the American people down. And I have to carry that burden with me for the rest of my life. My political life is over. I will never yet, and never again, have an opportunity to serve in any official position. Maybe I can give a little advice from time to time. And so I can only say that in answer to your question that while technically I did not commit a crime, an impeachable offence â these are legalisms. </p>

<p>As far as the handling of this matter is concerned, it was so botched up, I made so many bad judgments. The worst ones â mistakes of the heart rather than mistakes of the head, as I pointed out, but let me say a man in that top judge job, he's got to have a heart, but his head must always rule his heart.</p>
