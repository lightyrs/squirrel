<div class="content"><p><b>Moira Roth</b>: I'd been living in Berkeley, during the 60s with all that that implies, and I got into graduate school in art history, and then at the beginning of the 70s I went down to Southern California and I plunged into all different sorts of feminist circles. I went to a famous breakfast meeting about the museum, the county museum and the fact that it had a show of all male artists. Met Judy Chicago. I went to Joyce Kozloff's gathering, where a lot of women came and just talked about what they were doing, and the circumstances in which they were doing it. And then out of that I taught firstly at UC Irvine, and then I really settled in 1974 at UC San Diego. And that was a marvelous place for performance, when Eleanor Antin was teaching there, Alan Kaprow. There were enormous numbers of comings and goings. I began to spend a lot of time in L.A., met people like Suzanne Lacy. And so I had the, the beginning of my contacts, including with you Lynn, and then all these relationships in Southern California. And began writing. I went from Marcel Duchamp to performance art. I loved doing interviews. I loved going to performances, and out of all that came a book called The Amazing Decade: Women and Performance Art in the 70s. </p>

<p><b>Lynn Hershman</b>: Can you define the difference between the east coast feminists and the west coast feminists, and what the split was between them? </p>

<p>: I thought a lot about that. On one simple. . . . </p>

<p>When one thinks of what happens in feminist art, feminist performance art particularly in the east and west coast, the east coast had much more not an intimidating series of traditions but certainly was very embedded in experimental dance, experimental theatre, experimental music. I knew all those wonderful people like Yvonne Rainer, Meredith Monk. It seemed more free-for-all on the West Coast. It wasn't that there wasn't experimental theatre and dance, music with people like Pauline Oliveros. There were people like Rachel Rosenthal. People like Anna Halperin. But it somehow, in terms of performance art, it seems that one could do. . .I don't know how to put it. . .more edgy work. Edgy work, because there wasn't quite so many traditio-[interrupted] on the West coast. There was also so much going on in terms of demonstrations. There was almost a performative mode of demonstrations that very easily connected with women's performance art, protest art, speech art, that kind of thing. </p>

<p>: Was that on both coasts?
</p>

<p>: I know far less about the east coast, but my sense is that the artists' work that has become very well known on the east coast were more directly connected with these experimental traditions in dance and music and theatre.
</p>

<p>: Was there at any point a rift between the east coast and the west coast? </p>

<p>: A rift? There were certainly a lot of attempts to bring them together. There were various conferences. It's really not something that I was caught up in. I, from the beginning, knew people on the east coast. I think that more there was a separateness rather than a rift, as far as I'm concerned. And then there were certainly artists, for instance, Miriam Schapiro who'd come from the east coast and then was on the west coast for quite a lot of time. Joyce Kozloff and come from the east coast, and then much later on Faith Ringgold.
</p>

<p>I don't know if this caused a rift but there was certainly an issue of critical attentiveness in terms of availability of resources, availability of critical writings, which certainly was much more of a tradition on the east coast than the west coast. So, there was far little. . . .far little sort of spaces in which artists could do things on the west coast. You for instance did that marvelous Dante Hotel piece, but that was in a hotel. And there were certainly spaces, museum spaces, but they came rather late in the game. For example, it was very late when the museum of modern art in San Francisco did an exhibition of performance art. </p>

<p>So, I would argue that though this had many disadvantages, it also gave a creative freedom.
</p>

<p>I would argue that this lack of art writing, ????, the lack of critical attention, right? Although there was of course high performance, which was absolutely major, that it allowed a certain sort of freedom. If you weren't going to be written about, you weren't going to be put in museums. It meant that, like it or not, you had to improvise. You had to improvise more in terms of space, equipment. But it had a great advantage. </p>

<p>: My understanding was that there was a kind of class rift, where say Faith Ringgold, Suzanne, were more against academics. . . .??? </p>

<p>: It's not my reading of it.
</p>

<p>: Did you know at the time what was happening and how important what was happening was, and what were the women trying to do? </p>

<p>: Well, I wrote, or edited this book called The Amazing Decade, and it truly was an amazing decade in terms of what demands, laments, insights, confusions, and there was all this push in terms of the women's movement, for a quality on all different levels. A quality at home, a quality in the work place, a quality politically, a quality legally, socially. And so it was a very heady ambience in which performance art happened. And performance, it seems to me, was an absolutely marvelous vehicle for this.
</p>

<p>: What is your understanding of how it happened? </p>

<p>: The feminist movement came out of a lot of things, one of the obvious things is the 60s. The civil rights, the inner qualities within so many different aspects of the 60s, in terms of how women were treated, including in radical groups, like the Art Workers Coalition in New York. And so by the later 60s, there was a passionate need for women to become separatist, to begin articulating things, not simply quietly within a movement but as a movement itself. </p>

<p>: What was the first feminist work that you can think of that defined itself? </p>

<p>: I think some of the early performative work that I think of was, for example, the protests around Miss America at Atlantic City. There was a wonderful, very very unruly demonstrations at the Whitney at the Biannual where Faith Ringgold brought in whistles or false passes. Eggs were strewn around, tampaxes. So, those were perhaps not official performances but they worked beautifully in terms of performance history. And they were, as I said, they were very unruly. In terms of early almost official performance, there were those very amazing pieces by Yoko Ono, for instance. The Cut Piece, with its questioning of the body, of the audience, etc, etc. There were early pieces, late 60s early 70s, where women explored a whole lot of things going from rage to despair, in terms of their own experiences. There were the issues of abortion that came up. There were issues of obviously the Equal Rights Amendment that colored a lot of things in the 70s. The fact that states had not ratified the ERA. Culminating in really an incredible explosion in New Orleans, where there was the issue of Should one boycott the state because it hadn't ratified the ERA, or should one go there and do something different, take feminist actions? </p>

<p>There were those absolutely extraordinary gatherings together organized by Suzanne Lacy. Small dinner parties that became grander and grander, and then out of that you had The women of the delta, the river meetings. And then a whole lot of other performances there, and then you had this exhibition-the Amazing Decade: A Decade of Women in Performance Art. </p>

<p><b>Kyle Stephen</b>: You were talking about how women created their own spaces to produce art. If you could talk a little more about specific spaces that were developed on both locations and how those came into being. </p>

<p>: I think it was very much part of that. In San Francisco, there was the Floating Museum that Lynn Hershman organized. There was the Bonnie Sherk's farm, both of which were quite extraordinary theater spaces. There was the Womanhouse in L.A., and the Woman's Building more generally. There were spaces on the east coast, for instance Franklin Furnace was run by a woman, Martha Wilson. And so there were these spaces in which art of all sorts happened, but particularly it was very supportive to performance art. I think they allowed a very interesting audience to come. I think audience was very key in feminist performance. </p>

<p>There was this, firstly performance allowed a gathering together in a way that, unless you would go to an opening, you don't all look at paintings together, or sculpture, but you do tend for public performance, to come as a group. So it's a very interesting relationship of performance audience to the performers. And these spaces allowed that kind of thing. I think they were environments, protective spaces in which a lot of things could happen. And then I think High Performance was another space where a lot of . . .it was quite easy to publish in High Performance, and it was very simple. If you're an artist you could have a photograph and then a very short description. So that was very important. And that was on the West Coast, that wasn't ever launched on the east coast. So, these spaces, be they physical spaces or published spaces were very necessary to the development of performance art. And particularly women's art. </p>

<p>: Can you talk a little about what was different about female performance and what were the key elements that were separating it from the other strands of performance art happening at the time with male artists. . .things like autobiography, narrative, rituals. . .things that came to be identified as feminist performance? And what was the influence of that? </p>

<p>: There was of course a huge amount of male body art, Chris Burden, etc etc. I think what was absolutely heady were the ones looking at Carolee Schneemann, or ones looking at Rachel Rosenthal, or ones looking at Faith Ringgold or Adrian Piper, is that there was a marvelous boldness when women took on the body. They took on the body not on the passive receiving end but on the creating new sorts of bodies and new ways of viewing it. There's a lovely piece by Eleanor Antin called Carving, which she literally carves away part of her body by dieting for ten days. There are the extraordinary early Carolee Schneemann pieces. There are, later for example, Faith Ringgold piece where she loses weight. It's called Change. She literally diets for a year and loses an enormous amount of weight. There are these poetic uses of the body, sometimes the costumed body, the fictional body. The body of, Lynn you did the Roberta Breitmore body, so to speak. Your body, but it becomes the Roberta Breitmore body and it's clothed in a certain way and you made up in a certain way. Eleanor Antin extravagantly became the King and the Ballerina. </p>

<p>I think the ease is that there's a long tradition of males in theater, in art, etc., performing actively. There's a long tradition for instance of the woman being the model, the woman being the odalisque, the woman being looked upon. And so when feminist performance began it literally was the looking back. The challenging of the gaze, if you want to call it that way. So, it was this very active woman's body. That seems to me, was extraordinarily new, and it went with a whole lot of other things to do with women becoming active, taking stands, as bell hooks uses the phrase, Talking Back.
</p>

<p>: Was feminism in its origin and its inception a political act? </p>

<p>: It's a political act. It's also a social and political sort of social and psychological act. The more you feel strengthened and hardened the more you can take political stands. So it went back and forth. You know that famous phrase The Personal is the Political, where everyone found that what they thought was an isolated experience became very much something that many people had in common. So I think it was certainly political and it made a lot of political and legal demands. But, it came out of a strengthening of oneself, a psychic strengthening. And I think performance art was a wonderful arena in which that happened, both for the performers and for the audiences. </p>

<p>: Where does the phrase, Anonymous Was A Woman come from? </p>

<p>: What is it?
</p>

<p>There was for example this wonderful image of a huge number of women marching down Fifth Avenue in a way that they hadn't marched since the suffrage days. There were lots of demonstrations. There were issues about the ERA, there were issues about abortion, a lot of collective appearances of women. There were lots of very bold women, women like Bela Abzug. And certainly in the performance world there were a lot of women who assumed so many roles that they included bold roles. And they also included complex, weaker roles where you could examine why that woman became a desperate, why she became lonely, so it wasn't simply given as a statement. It was very much analyzed and put into psychological and social terms. So, there was a lot of examining. Martha Rosler, for instance, Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained, where she's measured ruthlessly, but it made you think of how women are measured ruthlessly. I think Roberta Breitmore was a very interesting character because she had her desperations and her loneliness but one was made to think about why she had lived that way and who she was and what she needed to give her more assurance.
</p>

<p>: Do you think women's performance was about getting out of a victimized role of society?
</p>

<p>: Yes, but it was also examining what it was like to be a victim and then what you did about it. So, it wasn't simply announcing This Was No Longer Right or proper or true. It had an experiential side, so you would ask yourself, including oneself in the audience, as to had one indeed had this victim role. What had been one's life as a child, as a girl child and things. And then what did one do about it. So, one both explored it and then protested it. And sometimes, within the same piece one explored it and protested it. There's an amazing piece by Rachel Rosenthal, early piece called Charm where she deals with a very painful childhood, and then in other pieces she becomes a very bold performer. I think it was enormously rich, what you could do with performance. Both within one performance, and then there was an accumulative effect of performance. If you went to a lot of performances you saw people being witty,, you saw people being desperate, you saw people being protesting, appeals for action. So, I must say that a lot of my feminist energy came from having gone to so many performances and written about performance, and things like that. I truly loved it. </p>

<p>: You speak of it in the past tense. </p>

<p>: I don't mean to speak of it as a past tense. I simply mean that I'm talking right now about early performance. And the performance that I was most immersed in and certainly most wrote about was in the 70s and early 80s.
</p>

<p>: And are there women now who have taken this tradition forward, or men, who are using what was originally inscribed in the 70s by women who were ?????? </p>

<p>: Yes, but I follow performance less now. And it may be not to do with the medium of performance, it may be to do with the fact that I do a lot of fiction and I write theatre and things like that. I'm struck in New York, where I was a couple of weeks ago, there was a huge event organized by Rosalee Goldberg, and there were Marina Abramovic recreations of pieces. I thought it was extraordinary that she would take a Vito Acconci piece, for example. Then there are now major books coming out. There's your book that's just come out, Suzanne Lacy's writings are just coming out. So a lot of the early performance is now being more elaborately put into art history. And then of course there's a lot of younger performance.
</p>

<p>: What artists now owe the feminist movement to the kind of work that they're doing?
</p>

<p>: Well there is always the issue, be it feminist art or impressionism, that the next generation comes along and has a different direction. So there are usually not effusive thanks to the previous generation, and that is absolutely inevitable. I think each generation has to formulate itself. And part of it is not simply dutifully echoing what happened before. If I sound evasive I think it's because it's tricky. . .it's a very tricky history that gets played out over and over again in culture. It's not at all peculiar to the feminist art movement. </p>

<p>You have to remember I teach at Mills College, and as far as the undergraduates are concerned it's just women. I also teach performance art history and I teach courses on women artists. And I have found very touchingly that there are a lot of very young students, like age 18, who would take a course on women's art and who will plunge into the 70s with great excitement. Sometimes they'll be critical, but they're also very very appreciative and very curious. And so I do quite ambitious projects. We do catalogs, we do web pages etc. My sense is of women students at Mills is that they deeply, deeply appreciate this early generation of women artists, the feminists of the early feminist movement. </p>

<p>But, they also have criticisms, for instance the issue of race in the 70s, or racism. On the other had we did an analysis of a book called The Power of Feminist Art, and they all had to report on it. And they would give a lot of credit to what happened, and the fact that they are now in 2005, so they're obviously going to read that period differently and they want different kinds of information. But it's been very touching. I have a kind of missionary goal to teach this early material and I think. . .at least the people that take my classes enjoy finding out about this period. And it isn't just women artists, it's the feminist movement in general. So, we look at films about demonstrations, we read early feminist text, and things like that.
</p>

<p>: Can you say a little bit about what elements of the history are being preserved and the politics of preserving. </p>

<p>: I think I obsessively now in my, I'm now 72, I obsessively think about what gets lost. I'm very struck sometimes when I go to visit an artist that they'll simply say they threw away things, they don't know where the photographs are, the tapes had got worn out or broken or things like that. So I brood about this constantly. I myself have a huge archive which I'm trying to figure out what to do with, and I have a wonderful assistant who is now putting, it's not just material on women artists, it's on DuChamp, it's on Cage, it's a huge amount. And she's now putting it on computer so it's fairly organized for the first time. And I really want those archives, and a huge part of them are on performance. I want them to go somewhere where they will be very accessible, both to scholars and artists. And I hadn't quite decided where that is. I feel very strongly about the fact that individual artists and individual critics have to make their work available, and it has to be stored. I'm sitting on masses and masses of audio tapes and videos. I started to video in the late 80s, I did a lot of videotaping.
</p>

<p>: What about things that are left out or people who are left out? </p>

<p>: I think what happens in art history is some people disappear forever. Some people temporarily disappear, and then out of the passion of a particular scholar or researcher they reappear. That's. . .just knowing the way art history works. But I think it's inevitable people disappear. But I'm also amazed how there are in these odd places, it could be my archives, it could yours, this material that no one's really looked at. I'm struck, in Hawaii for example, I talked to someone whose going to do a PhD and she wanted to work on the idea of silent early women's performance, as it were muted, maybe deliberately to suggest the silencing of voice, or maybe simply because it was focusing on the silent body. I then I immediately thought of things in my archives that I never really looked at in that frame. So, I think this constantly a losing and constantly a resurfacing or investigating, and I'm amazed how much undergraduates can do with this. I think undergraduates and graduates can do major major research in this area. </p>

<p>: Why is your book called The Amazing Decade? Did it stop at a certain time? </p>

<p>: Well, it was called The Amazing Decade because it was a response to an exhibition that Mary Jane Jacob was doing in New Orleans. And I did feel at the time, maybe I romantically still do, that the 70s for women was indeed an amazing decade. It was very very explosive and it was very inventive, and the most unlikely women got angry and the most unlikely women began to demonstrate, and the most unlikely women began to be imaginative, and the most unlikely women began to write. And that's what made it amazing. It had a very democratic quality to it. It was quite magical, and deeply. . .not just angry but so deeply poetic. </p>

<p>: Are there highlights from that time? </p>

<p>: High lights, for me personally? I remember, and I think it's because I was so involved in going to performances. I remember being profoundly affected by one performance after the next. And sometimes not even an individual performance, but having seen a lot of performances in several weeks. So there was an accumulative effect. I taught with Eleanor Antin and David Antin and the Harrisons and Jerome Rothenberg came, and a lot of artists came through UCSD, so there were a lot of discussions about performance. I myself did very elaborate performance classes where we would do 12-hour performances, for example. Which were wonderful. They'd begin at dawn and end at dusk. So, there was an accumulative effect of performance.
</p>

<p>: But you keep going back to performance as the major event of the feminist movement. Do you think performance was the thing of the feminist movement?
</p>

<p>: No, no, I think there were major, major traditions in painting and sculpture and photography and film and video. It's simply that a lot of my writing was focused on performance. I went for example, to the LA County Museum to see the Women Artists from 1550 to 1950, and all of us wept. I mean, the idea that there was this huge tradition of women artists that had never been collected before, that was very, very powerful. And there was an enormous amount of reading that I and everyone else did, like Simone de Beauvoir to Susan Griffin. And although everyone announced that painting was dead, it never was. So women became very powerful in that tradition. There was Judy Chicago's Dinner Party, right. This sort of odd mixture of sculpture, history, performative element. There were the wonderful works by Faith Ringgold. There were the imprints of Ana Mendieta's body. </p>

<p>: How can it affect culture?
</p>

<p>: Well there's been all this discussion about the representation of women in advertising and film and I think one of the things that's very painful is the slippage that constantly happens in terms of women, in terms of race, in terms of class, that when things aren't closely monitored there's a strange, even now, a default that things slip back to. So, when one thinks certain things have been safely established and one doesn't need to worry about them, then they begin to unravel and one has to return to worrying about them. </p>

<p>: How do you think feminism started to change, and the feminist art movement in general changed as it moved into the 80s, and what kinds of new issues started to arise?
</p>

<p>: Well, there's a huge argument going on between generations of feminists, that's clear. There's the also the issue, which I think is a very false one, that suddenly theory appeared, which included feminist theory and that somehow the 70s didn't have a theory. And in actual fact, most of the writers and artists I knew were extremely sophisticated intellectually, and did indeed theorize, although the language was very different from the 80s. But, I think that's one of the large differences between the 70s and the 80s. That there was the official emergence of theory. And that began to make a break, where there was the 70s. . .women in the 70s, many of whom were considered essentialist, as opposed to this more subtle theorizing in the 80s. It's something I disagree with totally. I think there's a lot of subtle theorizing in the 70s. And I think theory at its worst can have its essentialist aspects. So, that is one of the things that I think happened, but I think it's a very curious and false dichotomy. </p>

<p>: How do you think race and different kinds of sexual orientations in the 70s fit into the movement? (subcultures of identity)? </p>

<p>: There was indeed a lot of exploration of sexuality. Lesbianism, for example. There was a performance I went to that I was very, very moved by. It was called The Herstory of Lesbianism-the Oral Herstory of Lesbianism. It was done at the Woman's Building, and it was done I think around 1978, and it was quite an extraordinary piece. The evening that I attended was all women. The performance had been working for months doing a lot of oral history. It was very powerful, in terms of being a member of the audience. It had a wonderful series of almost vignettes where women out, declared themselves a lesbian, and then they would be accosted as to where they stood on a whole lot of other issues. And they would keep on saying, But I'm a lesbian. And they would say, How do you stand about this, how do you stand about that? And the audience went back and forth from laughing to crying. So there was a lot of exploration of sexuality-There was a lot of explosive exploration of race. </p>

<p>There were figures, for example, like Judy Baca, who is quite extraordinary in her work. There were also a lot of accusations. Many of them were, I think, correct, over the whiteness of the more official woman's art movement and the woman's movement in general. Where that left women of color. There was an exhibition that I didn't see but that I thought a lot about, which was organized by Ana Mendieta, was called The Politics of Isolation. There was performance, very, very powerful performance by Howardena Pindell called Free, White and 21, where she goes back and forth between being white and being black. And things really got to a head in the early 80s (telephone ring).
</p>

<p>As I see it in the early 80s, there was a huge need to have particular groups of women of color come together. There were groups of black women who already started in the early 70s, but then there were more race specific groups. For example, native American women came together. They had exhibitions. In the later 1980s there was AWAL, which is the Asian American women's art association in San Francisco that I was involved in. There were major shows of women of color. There were some wonderful national organizings of artist books by women of color. And it became more and more vocal, the issues of race and racism in the women's movement. </p>

<p>: Was that also from the 60s? How did the consciousness happen? </p>

<p>: Well there's obviously the Civil Rights. The Vietnam War I think in a complex way played out a lot of issues of race and racism. I think that there was a rather naÃ¯ve idealism when the women's movement began that. . . . .
</p>

<p>I think at the beginning generally, and certainly in the women's art movement, there was a rather naÃ¯ve idealism that all women were together, that they all dealt with the same issues, which obviously there were huge, huge divisions in terms of race and class, and geography, education, etc. etc.. But, that was glossed over with both language and the hope somehow that we would all work together for the good of the whole. So, that although there was a lot of surfacing of racism in the 70s, it really. . .as I said it probably came to a head in the late 70s early 80s. There was both a demand that these histories be retold, so a history of the 70s would not be a history of white women in the 70s. And then there was a need to have a lot of separatist groups. There were also needs to have, for instance, lesbian groups.
</p>

<p>: Was the invasion of Cambodia important in the creation of the feminist art movement?
</p>

<p>: I've just written a long essay on the American-Vietnam war. I myself would say not. Would you say that it was? </p>

<p>: Faith Ringgold said that that was the first feminist action, . . .WSABAL as reaction to Cambodia, Venice Biennale. </p>

<p>: With the invasion of Cambodia a group of male artists, admirably, were going to show in the Venice Biennale, decide to boycott it and they're going to have an exhibition in New York. In the meantime, absolutely brilliantly Faith Ringgold and Michelle Wallace take on the issue of the fact that, though this group that included as far as I remember people like Robert Morris for example, that they saw themselves as being very admirable have taken a political stand in terms of the U.S. government, that they weren't at all thinking about who would be in this other exhibition. And so Ringgold and Wallace, I think stunningly created a group of two, but it suggested there were many, many people behind them, demanding that women artists of color would be included. And Ringgold, at that point, who I know very well, did one action after another that was that kind of thing. She both worked within the women's movement demanding that it would do more with the issue of race, and she took on such things as. . . a very prominent white male artists who really felt very virtuous and were surprised when they were challenged. And that does obliquely come out of the invasion of Cambodia as having been the official American action that provoked this boycotting of the Venice Biennale.
</p>

<p>: And in a sense the first feminist action-the first action that insisted on integration.
</p>

<p>: Yes. And then of course, coming roughly around that but a little earlier is women drawing out of the Art Worker's Coalition, creating WAR. Those kinds of exhibitions that begin to happen both in New York and on the West Coast. But, certainly in terms of integration, that act, the act of Ringgold and Wallace, is very pivotal. It was 1970. </p>

<p>: And when was Judy Chicago's first class in Fresno? </p>

<p>: That happens at the same time. These west and east coast actions. I would say, for example, Howardena Pindell, I mean just getting back to the issue of race. Howardena Pindell who had this stellar background of a degree from Yale was a very prominent curator, became so enraged by the issue of racism, in terms of the women's movement and generally racism that she began to take on. . .she began to make various interventions. And the one that I mentioned before, Free White and 21 is extraordinary, but it's one of many investigations she made. And later on she superbly did a very almost scholarly investigation of showing records of museums and galleries, in terms of race.
</p>

<p>: Do you think that the Guerrilla Girls were effective? </p>

<p>: I think the Guerrilla Girls were hugely effective. That was another marvelous piece of theatre that worked very, very well. At one point the Guerrilla Girls who were doing so many imaginative and witty, but very angered examinations of the art world were taken on by a group called WASP, which was a group of artists of color. That they were challenged about not being sufficiently sensitive about the issue of race. And as far as I know they responded very thoughtfully to that. I think the Guerrilla Girls. . .I know many of them. . are very interesting group that draw from many circles, from writers, curators, artists. Those posters of theirs and their theatrical performances were stunning. And they worked in a way, perhaps at that point, in the 80s, that the earlier modes of intervention wouldn't have worked so effectively, in terms of making museums and galleries very embarrassed with that kind of Guerrilla Girl attention.
</p>

<p>: Was it effective? Did it change things? </p>

<p>: I think it did, yes. Definitely.
</p>

<p>I think they profoundly took on the art world and profoundly made the art world-whatever one means by the art world-nervous. And so this automatic, for instance, having an exhibition where there were no women in it, which is actually what provoked the Guerrilla Girls. That this became something that critics and curators became very nervous about. And a lot of the nervousness should be credited to the Guerrilla Girls and their really marvelous presence.
</p>

<p>: Is there a need for them now?
</p>

<p>: I think there's always a need for Guerrilla Girls. I think each generation should have its own Guerrilla Girls. I think a lot about that, about how different generations should be as it were Guerrilla Girls. I'm very struck at the moment there's far less protest in terms of the current politics than there was earlier on. </p>

<p>: . . .talk about some of the feminist art publications that started producing writing about the work and how it was successful or wasn't? </p>

<p>: Well, just like the Guerrilla Girls but earlier on you have around 1977 you have Heresies, which is absolutely extraordinary. And it was this mixture of artists and critics. Lucy Lippard for instance was just a magnificent presence right through this history. You have Heresies on the east coast. You have Chrysalis on the west coast. You have other publications, but just like some of these spaces. . sort of theatre spaces, institutional spaces, there were also these magazines where you could very consistently year in and year out deal with feminist issues. And Heresies was extraordinary. I wrote in the tenth anniversary issue, so I had this delicious pleasure of reading through all the issues and was astonished at what they had done. Both who wrote for them, but the kind of issues they took on. And certainly included uncomfortable issues. It included racism, it included class. </p>

<p>There was some on educationâ¦ a Heresies issue on education. There was a Heresies issue on traditional quilts, that kind of thing. And it was beautifully designed, it was very elegant. I think that was very special. Chrysalis in LA had the same. . .it worked less thematically but it also was a space in which a lot of people talk and a lot of people could archive what was happening. And then there were these major, major books. Lucy Lippard has this stellar record from beginning to end. For instance, her archives give a little echo of all the things she did that they're in various places. She's a beautiful and eloquent and deeply persistent writer about issues to do with women, and issues to do with race, and issues to do with ecology and history and memory and that stuff. </p>

<p>: We were talking about publications, and this is a chronology that I did with Janet Burdick and Alice De Biel (?). And Heresies and Chrysalis both began in 1977, so you have one on the east coast and one on the west coast. And you also have in Colorado a publication called Frontiers. And that's the point where, let me just begin in 1976. So, the setting is the American Bicentennial, Jimmy Carter is elected president. The U.S. Viking lands on Mars. Syrian troops move into in Lebanon. North and South Vietnam officially get reunited. And then in terms of women's history you have Women against violence against women. You have Barbara Walters becoming the first woman to co-anchor a TV program. </p>

<p>You have a marvelous book that all of us read so passionately, Lucy Lippard From the Center, from the essays on women artists, and that was a book that was a collection of her essays. She's been writing very intensely about women. You have Adriene Rich, this is all 1976, Of Woman Born, and you have Merlin Stone, When God Was A Woman. And then in 1977 you have more publications. You have for example an essay that I was very influenced by Martha Rosler, The Private and Public: Feminist Art in California. You have the Woman's Room by Marilyn French. You have Silences by Tilly Olsen. And then you have Faith Wilding putting together a lot of this early history in Southern California in a book called By My Own Hands: Women's Artist Movement in Southern California. So that sort of 1976-1977 is where a lot of things coalesce. You have these magazines and then you have Lucy Lippard. And Lucy Lippard in the meantime is writing more and more and more. But is an interesting moment in the mid-70s. </p>

<p>: Was there a self-identified group of women who called themselves the feminist art movement?
</p>

<p>: There's this whole question about language. Did one call oneself a feminist? Were artists identified with the feminist art movement, was it the women's art movement? For instance the famous issue of certain older artists didn't want to be classified as women artists, let alone feminist artists. There was also the issue of women artists of color would be another kind of language for women artists. I would say that sometimes it came up in a rather heated way. Other times people tried to smooth it over, successfully or not. But it certainly came up as to self-identifying and how someone says a critic or historian would identify. Like, I might have said that O'Keefe was very central to the history of women artists. O'Keefe would have said that that's not language she liked. And there are all these stories of people trekking up to see her, from these visits and things that really were not to her liking. And that's also true in the history of women surrealists. There certain women surrealists who did not like the language of the women's movement, and that continued to be true in the 70s. There were women, for example, who might have at one point been part of the women's movement, and then they wanted to move into different categories that weren't about there sex. I myself have loved the language. I would always try to put it, I'm a feminist artist or a feminist critic. And one of the reasons I love teaching at Mills is that young women are very happy to use the word feminist. A term I hate is post-feminist. </p>
