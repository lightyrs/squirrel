SAN JOSEâHad a great talk with Jim Harbaugh for the kick-off of my digital broadcast on the Mercury News website. I would recommend you listen to this one in its entirety.
We talked as Harbaugh was driving with his family down to Pebble Beach, on his first break from starting up at Michigan, and I told him that he was my first choice to be on my initial "TK Show" conversation.
Harbaugh said he liked that, and added:Â "This is my first podcast as well."

(I'll do the full transcript later. There's just so much here and I have to write a column on this now.)
I think we made it through OK.
-Q: So are you back in the Bay Area now for a little rest?
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, it was going 100 miles an hour thereâ¦.
-Q: Faster than 100 mph.
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, 200 mph there in January and the family was back here in California. So after we got the class signed and we had some Big Ten meetings with the other coaches and now I've got a cpoule days to be here with teh family here in Claiforni and then I go back on Sunday to prepare for spring practice.
-Q: What was it like to watch Ohio State win the national title?
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, it was good to see for the Big Ten, for the Midwest, for our conference, understanding that bar is set very high, at the highest level. And that's what we'll aspire to being. That'll take fierce competition to determine playing time, starters, positions and our place in the conferenceâ¦
Improvement will lead to success will lead to wins will lead to championships. That'll be our philosophy.

-Q: Does the Ohio State situation remind you of when you got to Stanford and you were looking at USC having established itself so clearly?
-HARBAUGH: Yes, it does. That's a very fair and good comparison. When we came into the conference into the conference in the Pac 10, no question about it. USC was at the top of their game and that's where Ohio State is.
And other teams in the Big Ten, tooâWisconsin, Michigan State, Iowa, Nebraska, Penn State. There's so many good teams in the Big Ten. It's a very competitive time for the Big Ten.
-Q: Was that Tweet you sent out, the Walter Scott quote, thought of the day: "What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive,' was that a reference to anything specific in recruiting?
-HARBAUGH: Nooo. It was a thought of the day. I didn't come up with that. That was Sir Walter.
-Q: Do you feel like the 49ers moving on to their new coach is something that has happened smoothly, with your former assistant Jim Tomula taking over?
-HARBAUGH: Uhh, you know I don't know that I really have a comment on that for you. I've been very focused on the issues that we have at Michigan and organizing our team and the challenges that we have ahead of us.
I must admit I've been much more focused on that.
-Q: There's been so much comment from Jed York that it was a mutual separation between you and the team, that you mutually agreed you wouldn't be the coach. Is that true? Or were you told that you wouldn't be the coach any more?
-HARBAUGH: Yes, I was told I wouldn't be the coach any more.
And thenâ¦ you can call it 'mutual,' I mean, I wasn't going to put the 49ers in the position to have a coach that they didn't want any more.
But that's the truth of it. I didn't leave the 49ers. I felt like the 49er hierarchy left me.
-Q: Were you told this the Monday after the game in Seattle?
-HARBAUGH: Yes.
-Q: You could've left at that point, right? You decided to coach the final two games because you wanted to finish this out?
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, I did. I wanted to finish what I startedâwhat we started. And I have great fond memories of it.
-Q: I don't think they're going to be forgotten.
-HARBAUGH: Well, I am never going to forget the players, the loyal coaches and the memories that I have of being a part of the San Francisco 49er team.
-Q: Do you think 49ers management decided that they didn't want you back long agoâmaybe early in the season?
-HARBAUGH: Â You know I don't know all that. I don't want to speculate. You may know. You may know better than I know.
-Q: You did ask me after the last game to investigate where the leaks came. And I understood that and I believe we should do that. I asked Jed York point blank if he was the leak, he denied it. I've since written that I believe he was. How do you think I've reported it so far?
-HARBAUGH: I can't say that I've read everything. I mean, I have a good ideaâI've got a pretty good understanding of some of the things that took place.
I don't think we were playing out of the same playbook. But maybe there'll be a book some day. Maybe I'll write a manuscriptâ¦
-Q: I'd like to read that one.
-HARBAUGH: (Laughs.) Those are good questions for him and the 49er hierarchy. And we'll leave it at that.
-Q: What was your relationship like with Jim Tomsula at the end? Did you feel like he was at all campaigning for your job while you still had it?
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, that's a good question for him. Better than to me.
-Q: Was it awkward? His name was certainly out there as a possible potential replacement.
-HARBAUGH: Uhh, there was definitely a point where you walk down the halls and youâ¦ I wasn't reading anything that was on the Internet, I was really focused on doing my jobâ¦ but definitely walk down the halls and people look away or they look at you and you know something's going on.
That's really about the extent of the knowledge that I have on it.
-Q: That can't be a comfortable situation to work in.
-HARBAUGH: Better questions for others.
-Q: Colin Kaepernick is someone you're closely associated with. Where do you see his career going after last season?
-HARBAUGH: He is a great player. He is an amazing competitor, talent at the highest level, effort at the highest level, execution at the highest level.
You know exactly how I feel about Colin Kaepernick. I love Colin Kaepernick and I will be pulling very hard for Colin Kaepernick from Ann Arbor, Mich., and all of the players. I have the utmost respect for them as competitors and professionals.
-Q: I thought you were going to stay in the NFL, that you were an NFL guy. Was it only Michigan that drew you out of the NFL?
-HARBAUGH: For me, there's a lot of great jobs, great opportunities, I know, in coaching. But for me, the Michigan job wasâthat was the best job for me. That was the decision I made that that was the case. I'm having a blast and really enjoying being in Ann Arborâ¦
-Q: Did you ever look at another jobâI know you spoke briefly to Mark Davis, did you consider the Raiders at all, or any other NFL job?
-HARBAUGH: There was neverâ¦ I really didn't look at any other situation. I didn't do a pros and cons list or anything. It was just a decision I made from the heart and that was it.
I was going to go to Michigan.
-Q: Â When I asked you if you'd miss the NFL on your last day with the 49ers, you said "is it going anywhere?' I imagine you were watching the playoffsâ¦
-HARBAUGH: Yeah, I went to the Baltimore Ravens' first game. So I was near it again. There supporting my brother.
It didn't go anywhere. It's still there and it's going strong. Yeah, I did watch the playoff games and I watched the Super Bowl. I thought that was a credit to football, the way that game was played.
That's an amazing field of competition.
-Q: Do you run the ball at the end there or do you throw it?
-HARBAUGH: You know, I really thought they had a good play called. That was an insightful play against a goal-line defense, and a really neat combination that they hadâwith an inside pick play. It really was open.
And that young man from the New England Patriots made a playâI mean, that is a play that the stars of the game don't make. He made a play that wasâ¦ at best that ball gets knocked down and incomplete. But to make an interception on that playâ¦ what a phenomenal play. That was the play of a lifetime.
And all credit to him for making it.
-Q: I'm going to ask these questions to everybody on this series. What's your favorite current television show these days?
-HARBAUGH: I really haven't had too much time but I did start watching this show called "Hell on Wheels," you know that show?
-Q: I don't. What network?
-HARBAUGH: You can get it on Netflix. I think it was AMC that did the show. But pragmatist Cullen Bohannon, post-Civil War, they're building a railroad, trans-continental rail road. It's got some tremendous history and story to the show.
It's a real, real good show. This Cullen Bohannonâyou could just see Justin Smith or Dan Skuta in the role of Cullen Bohannon. He is a guy's guy. He is a man's man.
