<div id="transContent"> <p id="description">Steven Spielberg is the 12 billion dollar man, the most successful movie director of all-time. His four-decade resume spans every genre, from adventure to historical epics. After Schindler's List, the movie that finally bagged him an Oscar, he bankrolled the Shoah Foundation, a film company of a different kind, which has collected for history's sake video testimonies from tens of thousands of holocaust survivors. Recently I went to Los Angeles, where he was editing War of the Worlds, Steven Spielberg's new movie, to speak with him. He began, and perhaps this should not have surprised me, by directing the interview.</p>

<p>Why don't you just jump back here with the crew? That would be great.</p>

<p class="question">This is how I want this interview to start, because if Steven Spielberg cannot direct this interview no-one can.</p>

<p>No, it is just that I have a problem with people at my eye line.</p>

<p class="question">No, this is fantastic. Is the lighting okay? Are we happy?</p>

<p>It's beautiful.</p>

<p class="question">Then we can proceed.</p>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p class="question">Steven Spielberg, welcome to the show. Thank you very much for joining us. War of the Worlds is your 22nd feature film as a director. I heard Dustin Hoffman recently saying that before you start shooting you are so nervous that you are physically ill before the first day. Is that true? </p>

<p>Maybe a long time ago when I was in my 20s I would get sort of nauseous stage fright. Now I am just ill. Not physically ill, I am just ill. Every day I shoot a movie, every morning. But every time I begin a new scene I get that stage fright, that little bit of those opening night jitters, which I think is a very healthy thing, because it kind of pushes me. It kind of humbles me and makes me realise that I do not have all of the answers, and thank goodness I do not, because the whole process of movie making is a discovery process. </p>

<p class="question">What is it you think could go wrong in your nightmare? What is the director's nightmare? </p>

<p>My nightmare is that I won't make a very interesting scene out of it, that I will make a scene that I throw out later and re-shoot a month later at great cost to the production. Every single day there are amazing opportunities. Some of them you capitalise on and some of them you totally overlook. That is just the way it is in movies. When people talk to you about twenty-twenty hindsight, they are talking to you about, "If I had this picture to do all over again what a great film I would have made, because now I know how to make this movie properly." I think that is what I am referring to. You do not want to miss those opportunities. That is where a little bit of the 'spielcus', as we say, comes from.</p>

<p class="question">The which? </p>

<p>It is Yiddish for a nervous stomach. </p>

<p class="question">I see. That is very good. Is there a film of yours, in fact, I am willing to bet there are quite a few films of yours, that you look at and think, "I would do that completely differently now"? </p>

<p>I don't know if I would do the entire film completely differently, but I always see sequences that I would have done differently had I known more had I known what I now know. </p>

<p class="question">With War of the Worlds - and you talk about nerve in making films - there is a great line actually, which is 'Why does Hollywood remake a classic? Because they didn't get it wrong the first time.' You are not just remaking a classic film, it is a classic book and a classic radio play as well. Do you feel that extra sense of that dreaded word "expectation"? </p>

<p>Not really. There are certain films that I consider virtual classics, a film like Lawrence of Arabia or It's a Wonderful Life or The Best Years of Our Lives or The Godfather. There are certain classics that no-one in their right mind, I think, would or should go near to remake. But there are other films that are cult classics. I think War of the Worlds falls into that latter category. It is not really a generic classic, it is just a niche classic. But for the most part I really wanted to tell a story about an alien invasion in a very serious sort of a dark way as if it were happening in 2005. So in that sense I think this is more of an adoption of the 1898 HG Wells book than it is of the 1953 George Powell produced movie.</p>

<p class="question">So now you are really bothering me. Because I saw you said a serious dark story the original film when I was about eight and it was the first film that truly scared me. I hid behind my bedroom door. Please tell me this film that you are making is not scary. </p>

<p>It is scary. </p>

<p class="question">Please don't say that. </p>

<p>It is scary. </p>

<p class="question">I will not be able to see this film if it is scary. </p>

<p>You have grown up. It is PG13 and it is not at all a horror movie in the sense that it is not a blood or gore fest or anything like that. Although I think the movie is primarily a scary film. It reaches, hopefully if we have done our jobs right, to you on a kind of level as if this was a news event. You just see it happening and say, "Oh, my God, this is terrible. This is really, really scary." I try to make my version of War of the Worlds that way so that, even though the whole thing is through the eyes of this family, you really think it is happening not just to the family but happening to the audience. That is what we are all trying to achieve making any movie, not just War of the Worlds. You are trying to reduce what they call the aesthetic distance between the audience and the characters. So the audience winds up inside the experience not outside looking in.</p>

<p class="question">One of their expectations for this is they are going to be scared, they are going to be frightened, that is part of the thrill? </p>

<p>If they are not, I will suffer the consequences.</p>

<p class="question">Being scared is something that is of interest to you. As a kid you used to scare your sisters, didn't you?</p>

<p>Yes, I scared my sisters as a kid, but I used to scare myself first. I was a cheap scare, is what I was. </p>

<p class="question">How would you scare yourself? </p>

<p>I could just scare myself. Actually, I could look at myself in the mirror and scare the crap out of myself. I would just stare at my eyes in the mirror and I would suddenly not become myself, I would become the image in the mirror and I would put my identity into the image and I would find myself suddenly looking at myself from, you know, a reflection, not from inside my being. Kind of like an out of body experience. I would do that a couple of times and I would just never do it again. My hair would stand up on end, I would yell and I would run out of the room. So I knew very early on that I could scare myself doing something very weird and esoteric like that. </p>

<p>So I thought, "Why should I torture myself? I have got three younger sisters. Wow, I have an audience." They were my first audience. When I made Jaws and people threw popcorn in the air a couple of times in that movie - I had seen my sisters throw their popcorn in the air when I would sneak up behind them or put something scary in the room and turn off the lights. I was a terrible brother, but I loved them and they loved me and we got along great. But I was like a creature right out of Grimm's Fairytales for them. </p>

<p class="question">But every brother in the world can relate to that. This business of scaring yourself, what was the fascination for you in that sensation? </p>

<p>I guess I didn't have a lot to do. When you wind up staring at yourself in the mirror trying to scare yourself with yourself, then you do not really have an active social life. </p>

<p class="question">You mean you needed to get out more? Is that what you are saying? </p>

<p>I needed to go out and meet some girls, get some girlfriends, socialise. I was more of... God, I was really a lonely kid. I didn't spend a lot of time with a lot of friends. I didn't have a lot of friends when I was growing up.</p>

<p class="question">The whole business of things coming from outer space is such a potent human fear. This has kind of loomed in your life since you were young. When you were very young, I think your dad took you out to look at a meteor shower. What do you remember of that night? </p>

<p>I remember it vividly. My dad woke me up and it was scary, because my dad had never gotten me out of bed while it was so dark. He said, "I have to show you something." I was terrified. I kept saying, "Dad, tell me" and he wouldn't tell me. I got in his car, there was just the two of us. I guess with my father it was like a bonding moment. With me it was, "Where is my dad taking me in the middle of the night?" We drove about 10 minutes to a park. He took out a big blanket and we spread the blanket out and there were about 100 people, maybe more. I was a kid, maybe there were less, I just know there were a lot of people. They were all looking up at the sky. They were all lying on picnic blankets looking up. We lay down on the ground and looked up. I now know it was the Perseus meteor shower, but I didn't know what it was called then. For the first time I thought every like 15 seconds there was this streak of light across the sky, this green or blue streak of light. My dad explained what a meteor was and what a meteorite was and I had learned a lot that night. I think that is where I began my love affair with the sky. </p>

<p class="question">...Which you continued. You talked about as a kid you did not have anything to do, but you absolutely did. Your first feature film was also about things in the sky. </p>

<p>It was. </p>

<p class="question">Firelight, when you were 16, 140 minutes, you wrote and directed it, and your dad hired the local theatre for its premiere. What was opening night like? </p>

<p>It was just like I explained about the first day of shooting on a movie. And then I did get physically ill. I was so terrified. It was the first time I really showed one of my movies to a public that wasn't a bunch of kids my age that were paying a dime to get into the family room of my house to watch some movie I would show on a sheet on the wall. This was something that I had made and this was something that I spent a year making. And I didn't know the people who came to the movie. It was 500 strangers, and they all paid one dollar to get into the theatre in Phoenix Arizona. </p>

<p>Also, I had to run the projector and the sound, so I had to get the music in sync with the movie. I had a reel-to-reel tape recorder and I had all my cues, but I had to really work during the screening. I could not even listen to the audience, listen to whether they were paying attention to the movie or caring or getting up or coming back. I was only focused on little cues that I had put on the eight millimetre film - eight millimetres is only this big - with a pin. You saw a little white flash, that was my cue to start the next music cue. It was really crazy.</p>

<p class="question">That's amazing. What a fantastic thing for your father to do, to hire the cinema. </p>

<p>My dad actually hired out the cinema, which didn't cost anything. It wasn't a cinema, it was a legitimate theatre. We set up our own screen and put the projector in the back. Because the projector didn't have a strong throw we had to put the projector more towards the centre of the theatre. So I had the audience behind me on both sides of me and in front of me. My dad paid for it. The movie cost 500 dollars in processing. That was how much it cost to buy the film and to process the film. We made 502 dollars that night. My first feature made two dollars profit, which I gave immediately back to my dad, because he was my producer. </p>

<p class="question">Wow, you have only added about 12 billion dollars to that since. Well done. You said that for a living you dream. What feeds your imagination? </p>

<p>I don't know. I guess my collective upbringing feeds my imagination. Everything that everybody was to me in my life and everything I ever saw and everything that I was ever interested in, everything that sparked my curiosity - all that becomes the food for the imagination.</p>

<p class="question">It is such a vast range of work that you have done. Looking at the schedule of what you have got coming up, television projects and all sorts of stuff, I am just curious about even in a working week like this what your inputs are, where you are drawing stuff from. </p>

<p>I have seven children, so I draw so much of my inspiration from my own family right at home. And then I am interested in the world and interested in what is happening in the world. I read a lot of newspapers and editorials and watch a lot of news. I watch news reality shows more than anything else on television.</p>

<p class="question">Do you daydream?</p>

<p>I daydream all the time. I have never stopped daydreaming. That is something that I really enjoy doing. I don't do it while I'm driving a car or operating any kind of dangerous machinery. But even sometimes when I'm with my kids I will tend to zone out and then sometimes they will pull me back and they will say, "Dad, dad," and I will hear them and I will look back at them again and they will say, "What were you thinking about?" They always ask me what I was thinking about. I will tell them. I will be honest, I will tell them exactly what I was thinking about. It encourages them to do the same thing, because I think they are all little dreamers and they have got their own wishes to be fulfilled.</p>

<p class="question">You do a thing with your kids, do you not, when you sit around at the dinner table, you encourage them collectively to make up story, is that right? </p>

<p>Mainly at night. I drive them to school every day, so we tell stories to each other on the way to school during car pool. At night we always have family dinners. The family always sits down together like an old fashioned Norman Rockwell painting, believe it or not, and we just talk. We talk about our days and we talk about homework and boyfriends and girlfriends the kids might be having and problems they are having with their peer groups and ideas and art projects. It is a real open forum, which is great. I had that. One of the great things about having kids is my parents did a good job in bringing me up and we had family dinners also. It's a really valuable part of my thinking. My whole life experience is listening and contributing at a table. It was hard growing up. There was a lot of stuff that wasn't so nice that was happening. Yeah, we talked about it. So I think that feeds a lot of my imagination when I'm making movies, just the fact that I'm open to seeing what is around me in the world and then making movies about it. </p>

<p class="question">So even when your parents were in the process of separating, that was talked about? </p>

<p>That part wasn't talked about, but the tension was certainly in evidence. We would still have family dinners and sometimes my mum and dad wouldn't speak. The four kids would talk to each other, but it was like there was an elephant in the room when they weren't talking. Literally we were saying, my mum would say, "Tell your father ... " and we would have to transfer messages from my mum to my dad when they were just sitting six feet apart. That was hard. That was really hard. But you know, that was all part of what you need to experience to figure out how to raise your own kids.</p>

<p class="question">The bit I don't get is you said you have got seven kids, a couple adopted, you drive the younger ones to school. You are there for dinner. As far as I can see, you are working on 4000 projects give or take in any given week. </p>

<p>I hope not.</p>

<p class="question">How do you do this?</p>

<p>I don't know. I think I'm really good at compartmentalising. I'm more lucid about my own work if I have got something to distract me. I can be making a movie and then I can go off that movie for a half an hour while they are lighting the set and I can be looking at the script and making changes with the writer on my next movie. I come back to the film I'm working on with a great deal of objectivity. Subjectivity is the director's worst enemy. </p>

<p class="question">Is that right?</p>

<p>It is losing sight of what you are doing and not being able to see it from the 15th row back where the audience lives. If I can't see my movie or most of my films from where the audience lives, then I just feel very lost. Sometimes if I am doing more than one thing at the same time I can keep that objectivity all the way through the shooting of the picture.</p>

<p class="question">You are said to advise young directors coming through that the key to success is to have absolute self-belief. You have had great success with a huge range of projects. What is the instinct that tells you something is going to work? </p>

<p>I don't know if something is going to work. I hope I have an instinct that something is going to work, but I don't rely on it, I don't depend on it. I am always thinking, "Well, this may not work." </p>

<p class="question">But you make a choice. There must be some moment at which you go, "That one is better than that one."</p>

<p>It is not, "That one is better than that one," sometimes it is, "What am I most interested in?" It is like a hobby. When something tickles my fancy I just can't get enough of it, I become obsessed by it. So I don't have to make a choice. It bypasses the brain and goes right in and pulls my guts and says, "Okay, you've got to make this movie" and I get pulled into it. </p>

<p class="question">Have you come close to perfection?</p>

<p>What is perfection? I don't know what perfection is. I never feel I've come close to perfection. I think I have made several films that I will be eternally proud of. Schindler's List I consider to be my best picture. I never used to say that. Before Schindler's List people would ask me, "What's your favourite film?" and I would use the old cliche line, which I am sure you have heard before, "How can you judge amongst your children which one you love the most?" Schindler's List was such an overwhelming experience for me, was such a personal experience for me, probably the most personal, and I think because it inspired and gave rise to the Shoah Foundation, which is the most important work I've done outside of my family, that I have to always go back and credit that picture. </p>

<p class="question">As a kid you weren't really comfortable with your Jewish-ness. You didn't like your grandfather calling you by your Hebrew name. The local kids would stand outside the house and cry out "Spielbergs, the dirty Jews", and now you have embraced Judaism. How important has that journey been for you? </p>

<p>It was very important. I embraced Judaism when I was much younger, certainly. I was 'bamitsfaed'. We never kept kosher, but we did when my grandparents came to visit. We were, you know, Jews of convenience, not so much of tradition. My mum and dad respected their parents, who were kosher and very religious and orthodox. As my dad got more successful, he moved to areas of the country where there weren't Jewish families. I went to school without Jewish friends and did not have Jewish community centres to go to. So I was kind of like an odd duck, so to speak. There was a lot anti-Semitism because anti-Semitism comes from fear. But I learned something from all of this, and it wasn't to turn the other cheek. What I learned was that when people don't like you it's because they are afraid of you, it's because they don't know you, they don't understand what you are all about. I wanted the Shoah Foundation to be able to correct that mistake. I wanted that to really be open and honest and let people know what this is all about. </p>

<p class="question">Which gets to the role of Hollywood and its enormous ability to influence. This film, War of the Worlds, is a movie about mass fear in an age of fear. America is a country with a very divided view of itself. What responsibility do you think Hollywood has at a time of propaganda, lies and terror alerts? </p>

<p>I was disappointed that Hollywood didn't do enough for John Kerry's campaign, compared to what Hollywood did for Bill Clinton's campaign, both campaigns. Both times he ran it was like night and day. Hollywood did not come out for the Democrats. The democratic Hollywood base, power base and money base, really didn't come out this year, and I was surprised about that. </p>

<p class="question">Why do you think that was?</p>

<p>It might have been that Hollywood is very interested in charisma and I do not think that Hollywood felt that John Kerry had the kind of charisma that Bill Clinton had and that they didn't come out in force. I came out for John Kerry. I thought John Kerry would have been a wonderful world leader and an American president. But we could not rally enough of the troops here in the film industry, which surprised me. The film industry can make an impact on who our president is. They have proven that in the past. </p>

<p class="question">About the role of Hollywood, is it simply to the Michael Moore's of this world, is it up to them to turn their lenses on America, or does Hollywood have a broader responsibility there that it has not yet taken up?</p>

<p>I think Hollywood has taken up the responsibility that all of us individually have to talk about current events through our movies. I am making a movie next year about Abraham Lincoln, the last five years of his life during the Civil War. I think that's a story that no-one has ever told before, because it is deemed not very commercial. Hollywood does not think that people are really going to run to period movies about iconic, important political and social leaders. But I feel that story has to be told. It's not about America today, but it has tremendous repercussions looking back about what America could be today under the right leadership. </p>

<p class="question">I don't wish to criticise, but I can't believe you are not doing the Woodrow Wilson story. But there we go. It's a matter of personal taste, isn't it? </p>

<p>I think Lincoln is more interesting. </p>

<p class="question">You once said that when directing Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws that you felt ridiculous directing him to be scared of a shark that wasn't there and you felt silly. Why did you feel silly? </p>

<p>It was only silly because I was seeing what the audience was not going to see and I wasn't realising that all of the flaws and mistakes in the mechanical shark. The fact that it wasn't really working very well - that only I was seeing. And I would shoot it in such a way that it wouldn't look like it was not working. I just would watch Richard looking at this mechanical shark and I knew that behind Richard acting his heart out he is saying, "My God, I just got the best reviews in history on Duddy Kravitz. What am I doing in this turd of a movie, this great white turd of a film?" So I would always see the anger and the smile behind Richard's eyes when he was really acting serious, I knew he didn't want to be there. After a while, we took turns not wanting to be there, luckily not all at once. But we all took turns not wanting to do Jaws. Thank God we did it, because it changed the course of all of our careers. </p>

<p class="question">Absolutely. One thing I have noticed, forgive me for being critical, but in all these films - I know you worked with Miranda Otto on War of the Worlds. </p>

<p>I did. </p>

<p class="question">There is no Nicole, there is no Geoffrey, there is no Heath, there is no Russell, there is no Travis Fimmel, there is no Steve Irwin, there are no Australians in your films, Steven. Do you have a problem? We are noticing.</p>

<p>I am correcting it by putting Miranda Otto in War of the Worlds. </p>

<p class="question">It's a small correction.</p>

<p>It's a big correction.</p>

<p class="question">She is a great act tress, but...</p>

<p>There is great, great talent.</p>

<p class="question">We are hurt. We are hurt as a nation.</p>

<p>As the nation?</p>

<p class="question">As a nation.</p>

<p>The nation had a cinematic revolution. There was a volcano of talent that just erupted. None of us expected it. I didn't know anything about Australia except we shot the second unit great white shark footage thanks to Ron and Valerie Taylor and Rodney Fox. The movie that put me on the map, thank goodness, was aided and abetted by Aussies. </p>

<p class="question">And this is the thanks we get. I want to pitch this to you. I know you said you are working on Lincoln. Hear me out. Nicole Kidman in the lead role. Tall thin, she had great make-up in The Hours. </p>

<p>She would have to wear the stovepipe hat and we would have to give her some facial hair. You know something, she has got the sense of humour.</p>

<p class="question">She could do it. </p>

<p>She would laugh. She has got a great sense of humour. I have known Nicky for many years and I'm a big fan of hers. </p>

<p class="question">Do you think she is a strong actress? </p>

<p>She is one of the greatest actresses in the world today. </p>

<p class="question">What makes her that? </p>

<p>I think that she is just an open vessel. These characters inhabit her like being possessed by a spirit, and she becomes that character and she is utterly convincing and I think almost every performance that she has given. Whether it's a light-hearted role playing a weather lady in a murder mystery for John Schlessinger or whether it's something like The Hours, I think she just gives devastating performances. </p>

<p class="question">You said that the most important thing to you is that your kids respect you. Of course, respect has to be earned. How do you earn respect for your kids? </p>

<p>The main thing is I try not to earn the respect of my kids, I just try to be myself. I don't go in there saying, "I have to prove something to my kids." I have to make them respect me. I have to do things for them that they will say thank you for." I never think about things like that. I just interact with them the way I do what comes naturally to me. I treat them not like children, I treat them like people. I treat them like my friends. The kids love that. All kids - when I directed Drew Barrymore when she was six in ET, I didn't talk to her like she was six years old. I sometimes came down certainly to eye level with her or if she got up where I was we were talking eyeball to eyeball. But I talked to her like I talk to my children today. </p>

<p class="question">So you got to be a practice dad effectively? </p>

<p>You know, after ET I wanted to have children so badly. I never wanted to have kids before ET, never even thought about it, never thought about being a father, settling down, getting married, having babies, never thought about that. After ET I came home and I cried. I cried on the last day of shooting because I wasn't going to see those kids for a long time. Drew I didn't let go of. I became I think a surrogate father for many years in her life. I really think that those kids inspired me to want to start a family of my own. </p>

<p class="question">Of course, when you are a dad it doesn't matter that you are Steven Spielberg, most successful movie director of all time, you are just dad and you are not just dad but you are often a daggy dad. When do you your kids think of you as daggy? </p>

<p>I think my kids think that I'm a daggy dad most of the time. If I don't understand the music, if I don't know who Green Day is the second they say Green Day. They say, "Dad, you don't know Green Day? They have been around for 10 years. Are you crazy?" I think that whenever I don't understand something that is part of their popular culture that has not quite reached me yet, they look at me the same way I looked at my father and mother when I was raving about The Beatles when they were on Ed Sullivan and my parents said, "Where is the beetle? There is a beetle in the house?" "No, they sing. There are four of them, John, Paul, George and Ringo. Mum, dad, don't you know?" </p>

<p class="question">Get hip. </p>

<p>I think it is generational.</p>

<p class="question">It seems to me that you are in a position where you can make whatever project you choose. When was the last time someone said no to you? </p>

<p>The last time someone said no to me was my wife and my kids. They say that all the time, constantly. When don't they say no to me? But in my professional world, if other people say no to me? People say, "I have an honest disagreement with what you are suggesting." I have had actors say, "I know what you want me to do, but I don't quite feel that. Can I show you first what I was thinking about and then I will try to do what you want me to do?" </p>

<p>When I direct, it is very collaborative and I try to get people who are intimidated by me when they first meet me. They know me by my movies and they get kind of freaked out. Then I think after 15 minutes talking to them they lose all of those inhibitions and they get very honest and I find out who they really are. I want to know who they are. I don't want to know what they are afraid of. I want to know what their ideas are, what they are going to contribute to their character, and maybe even what they are going to contribute to the entire story. Because I will take an idea about somebody else's character from another actor, if they have a good idea. </p>

<p>Movies are not like painting. It's not like painting a picture where you are alone with a canvass in a loft somewhere in Soho. To me movies are about how good are 100 people working together to tell a single story, not how good is one person telling a single story. </p>

<p class="question">Tennessee Williams described fame and wealth and success as the wolf at the door, the opposite of struggle and deprivation out of which comes true creativity. You have both these things, wealth and success. How do you see them?</p>

<p>Success certainly produces one thing for me. It happened after Jaws. After Jaws I was able to have something called the final cut. I was able to determine the outcome of my movies without anybody interfering. I had the legal precedent to stop a studio from taking my movie away from me, changing it and putting it out in theatres. So success to me meant freedom. </p>

<p>Wealth, on the other hand, does not really figure in to me in a way that's distracting from anything. My wife and I, Kate, work very hard on treating our kids like normal kids and not making them feel entitled or empowered to make demands because of a certain strata of knowledge they have that, "Daddy made Private Ryan which made a lot of money so when is that trickling down to me?" I think our kids have very normal lives. We moved from a very large house to a very small house so we could be closer together as a family now. But I think the first question is an interesting one, that success means freedom. </p>

<p class="question">In this town where everyone has an idea to pitch, how is it possible for you to move around? I can only imagine. Do you have minders that go into rooms and sweep them for creatives before you enter? </p>

<p>No. But I have to disappoint a lot of people. A lot of people come over to me with story ideas and scripts and treatments and I have to say to all of them, "I legally cannot hear your pitch. Don't tell me your ideas and don't give me a piece of paper with anything written on it. I legally can't receive a pitch." I have been trained over many, many years of all sorts of legal cases. Fortunately all of them that we have prevailed on - not to ever receive unsolicited material from strangers or even people I know. </p>

<p class="question">This is an awkward moment, then, because I have a great idea. Hear me out. This is two blockbusters. You are going to love this - Raiders of the Lost Orc. Lord of the Rings meets...</p>

<p>This is on video now, you see. </p>

<p class="question">I know. Just a seven-picture deal, that's all. </p>

<p>What is it? </p>

<p class="question">Lord of the Rings meets the Raiders franchise. </p>

<p>The Raiders franchise. </p>

<p class="question">Raiders of the Lost Orc. </p>

<p>I would rather do Lord of the Raiders, Raiders of the Lord. </p>

<p class="question">We can work on this. I think we should do it on the DreamWorks jet. I'm just talking seven pictures, not too much. I'm only the millionth person to try and pitch to you. Steven, it's been really good talking to you. </p>

<p>It's been a pleasure talking to you. </p>

<p class="question">Thank you very much. </p>

<p>I have had a great time.</p>
