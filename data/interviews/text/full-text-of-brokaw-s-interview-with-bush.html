<div class="articleBody">   <p> Q Mr. President, there's no tougher decision any President makes than to commit the nation to war. Let's talk about that first night, when you surprised us all by launching the preemptive strike against the residence of Saddam Hussein. </p>

 <p> THE PRESIDENT: Well, they started in the Situation Room, and we had Tommy Franks on the screen with a Commander -- I think out of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait City and out of -- and a CENTCOM commander out of Tampa Bay, along with their British and Australian counterparts. </p>

 <p> And then we had the national security team aligned on the table there. I went around to each of the commanders and said, are you happy with the strategy, do you have what it takes to win the war? They all answered affirmatively. </p>

 <p> I then gave the instructions to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld that Operation Iraqi Freedom would commence at a time of Tommy Franks' choosing. Told Tommy, you know, for the sake of peace and security and the freedom of the Iraqi people that he's got the orders to proceed. I asked God for blessing on him and the troops. He saluted, I saluted back and left the room. </p>

 <p> It was a -- it was an emotional moment for me because I had obviously made up my mind that if we needed to, we would use troops to get rid of weapons of mass destruction to free the Iraqi people. But the actual moment of making that decision was a heavy moment. I then went outside and walked around the grounds, just to get a little air and collect my thoughts. </p>

 <p> I thought I was pretty well through with the day, until 3:40 p.m. that afternoon, when I got a call from Secretary Rumsfeld that said, Mr. President, the plans have changed. He said, I would like to change the plans, I need your permission to change the plans. Can I come over? He didn't say, the plans had changed, but I knew what he told me on the phone, it would mean the plans would have changed. And that is, we had a shot at Saddam Hussein they thought. </p>

 <p> So I assembled the national security team of the Vice President, Colin Powell, Rumsfeld, Myers, CIA Tenet, Condi Rice, Andy Card and some other CIA agents there -- some guys I hadn't seen before came in the Oval. And the reason why they were there is they had a source on the ground that was convinced that not only would Saddam Hussein be in the complex, but Uday and Qusay, his two sons, would be there as well. And they explained why this was the case. And basically they were asking permission from me to launch an air strike. </p>

 <p> I was hesitant at first, to be frank with you, because I was worried that the first pictures coming out of Iraq would be a wounded grandchild of Saddam Hussein -- but Saddam Hussein, who was not there at the time we started making the decision, would never show up -- that the first images of the American attack would be death to young children. </p>

 <p> And this is an interesting moment, because as time went on during the day, or that evening, the intelligence got richer and richer. In other words, the guy on the ground was calling in to the CENTCOM headquarters, who was immediately calling in to the White House more and more information. For example, he discovered that there was a bunker a hundred feet away from one of the houses -- a bunker that had so much concrete and was likely to house Saddam when he arrived, and his kids, his boys. </p>

 <p> And as the intelligence got richer, I got more confident with the notion that Saddam would, in fact, be there. And at 7:15 p.m. that evening, I gave the order for Tommy to proceed with an attack on the farms, but changed -- they had an ordnance package of 30 cruise missiles. But because of the bunker they had to change the timing of the attack so that the stealth bomber went in first, unloaded his ordnance and then the TLAMs, or the cruise missiles would follow in behind. </p>

 <p> Which means they had to reprogram all these missiles. And they didn't have much time to do it because the flight time of the missiles from their particular launch sites was about two hours. </p>

 <p> This other thing that bothered me during the decision-making was that the stealth would go in unescorted -- there would have been no air suppression on enemy defenses prior to him going in, in order to keep the element of surprise alive. So the day changed, and it was a dramatic several hours because we really changed the battle plan. </p>

 <p> Q Did you watch that on television, when the bombs began to land? </p>

 <p> THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did. I did. Actually, they began to hit and then I went in and shortly thereafter addressed the nation -- so I was getting make-up and talking about the -- you know, figuring out the words in the speech. I did. And it was about 9:30 p.m., as I recall, and then I spoke to the country about 10:15 p.m. </p>

 <p> But what was interesting, Tom, I don't think many people know this, is that the game plan was to move Special Ops forces early, at noon that day. And we would have explained to the country, as kind of creating the conditions for the battlefield, so that when our troops moved significantly their conditions would be ripe for success. </p>
