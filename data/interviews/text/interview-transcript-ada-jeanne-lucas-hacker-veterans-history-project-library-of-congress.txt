Ada Hacker:
1941, I was in nurse's training in Lutheran Hospital. I was, entered my senior year, because it was December in '41 that the whole business started. Q. Do you have specific memories of that?
Ada Hacker:
The excitement, yes. In the hospital everybody just went crazy. You could not imagine, well, everybody would say, well, I'm going to join the Army. Well, I had a whole year basically to go. The strange part is, of the women that had graduated only two of the class went into the service. They were free but apparently by that time they had other involvements. But anyway, that's the way it went. And then I finished the following October of '42, October 2nd. And I had a brother that was ill, so I took at job at City, which is Metro. And it was wild because they had the relief shift, 3-11, open, and I wanted to be able to work, leave City, take a streetcar downtown and take the last bus out to Bay Village at night, and I stayed with my brother, relieved her, took care of my brother all night. In the morning, I did as much as I could and then left, came back to the hospital, slept for about four hours, went on duty. Then I had my big meal of the day in the evening. Then at night -- I kept doing that for about four months. And then he died. And I took a break for about, I guess, a month, and played around, and joined the Army.
Thomas Swope:
When did you join the Army then?
Ada Hacker:
April of '43, I have on this one card, that I joined. You had to become like a Red Cross nurse. So there were about four of us then that decided we were going to join the Army itself after becoming that. And we had to go up to the Sandusky area, there was a place up there, for our physicals, and go through the business, which we did. There were two other women from Lutheran along with me. I remember my mother saying yes, fine, but she didn't want me leaving the States. So I very naively told the sergeant, I said, I want to join, but I don't want to -- I can't leave the United States of America. And he looked at me and he said, "You will be in the Army, ma'am; we give the orders, you don't," words. So, I soon found out he was absolutely right. After we were taken in -- very shortly after that we went down to Nichols General Hospital, which was in Louisville. And that's a big hospital where they had a lot of people back already from Europe and the Pacific Theatre. Long term. Unfortunately, we had a lot of mental cases, some of them before they went in the service, and others after. But anyway, all the new recruits get to go on nights. So, I was on nights practically the whole time. And I was only there -- not too long, about -- not quite six months. And I know I had to do one thing I hadn't really done in training, we had to do a gastric lavage. And these poor men, the ward I was on was medical, we had to empty, every morning, take and put the tube down and bring up the secretions. I hated doing it and, of course, the men absolutely hated having it done. This one man, poor thing, about seven days in a row, had it done. They just cringed when they saw me coming. But I was telling him, none of them wanted to wake up, and they all had trouble sleeping. We would, in the morning, first thing like around five o'clock, put on the Andrews Sisters, Bugle Call Rag. You know, real peppy, loud thing.
Thomas Swope:
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy?
Ada Hacker:
Boogie woogie. And we would put that on, and you would hear them moaning and groaning and carrying on. It did put them in good spirits, they admitted later. They had to have something, they had to wake up. Right now, every time I hear it now, I go right back to the war with all those poor men. Anyhow, it worked. It was not quite, I was going to say, not quite six months when I had about, oh, I don't know, four other people from Nichols were chosen, why we don't know, and put in this group that later became the 38th Field Hospital, which is a MASH unit. We went down to Fort Campbell in Kentucky, where we had our like a basic training. We met the woman who was to be our head nurse, Sophia Pulger Sulska (ph). Very strict Polish woman, we never considered a woman. She was -- we had 18 nurses, and the 19th was our head nurse. But anyhow, she was very firm. And she had to be. But she was a witch as far as we were concerned. But that's when they started us in like a basic training. Most of the time we were at camp, but we had basic training like the men. We had to learn to use a rifle, and we had to shoot it. Fortunately, they said just in the event, they wanted us to be able to pick it up and know what to do. We had to crawl on our bellies under live wire, ammunition shooting. We had to climb the ropes and the ladders. I don't know how I did it now that I think about it. We lost two of the women there. It was just too much physically. Two or three. But it was rough. If we weren't doing that kind of thing, we were marching with and without packs. They were trying to say -- you're probably -- you could go anywhere. You could be in a bad unit, you could be in the city and do nothing, but you have to be ready. They tested us more or less to see how, you know, how our stamina was. So, then we went from there, after all this marching -- some of the pictures show, I think, Camp Campbell, all the marching and stuff. Then eventually we had, like there were about 22 to start with, we ended up with -- we went to Camp Stoneman in California, took a train across. And that was -- it was crowded, and there were two of us to a bunk. I'll never forget. We were, most of us, skinny at the time, but it was so crowded. But it was so much fun. And it was filled with the guys, like we were going on a big picnic. But anyhow, we got there and had more of the same. And all this gear was issued to us. Like heavy, heavy, Navy at the time, clothes, like, you know, we were going to be in the winter, an area where it was winter. They were later changed to the green OD (ph) stuff when we got to Hawaii. But anyway, we had more of the same. We had a lot of indoctrination. They were still hazy, but you had a pretty good idea that we were going to go on, you know, the Pacific. Because we would have been sent to the New York area. So everybody there basically did go in the Pacific. There were units from all over. There were other hospital groups we met, and they already had like a name. We were told when we left Camp Campbell, we were the 38th Field. And some of them were general. We didn't run across another like the field or MASH unit, which surprised me. But anyhow, the majority of those they did later on, they said, went to Europe. But, oh, we must have been there about, oh, at least two weeks. Just constant, showing us movies, showing us things, how to do this, how to do that, whatever.
Thomas Swope:
Was it tough being thrown together with women from all over the country?
Ada Hacker:
In a way, but not really. To me, see, I was a young graduate. I graduated, I was 21 in August. Got out in October. And I was young and in for it, and I could take the things. I had had not an easy life; you know, big family, and things were rough, and I was kind of used to fending for myself. I got along great. I really did. When I think back on it, it was one of the most pleasant experiences of the whole Army. It was carefree. We didn't have the worry and all the other problems that came later. We met some wonderful nurses, we really did. We had some good ones that joined our group. We lost a couple more at Stonemand and we picked up some more at Stoneman. We went on the Lurelaine (ph), the SS Lurelaine, which was a luxury liner, on the way over there. But it was -- everything was blacked out. And everything was really rough, and it was just packed with soldiers and everything. And the food was -- I remember white crackers more than anything. There were three of us that did not get seasick, and I was one of them, which amazed me. Bringing back crackers to all the nurses that were so sick. You know, their stomach. Because it was a very rough crossing. I had never been on a ship before. I had no idea except I thought it was an adventure, again. But everything was black. You could not have any lights showing anywhere. You didn't play around. But anyway, we got there to Hawaii, Oahu, and it was gorgeous, beautiful. They took us to a place, Kameamea which is a girls school kind of up on a hill. Beautiful, fashionable girls school that the Army had taken over and was using, basically nurses, nurses from all over, and going out all over the place. They had a big hospital, 224th General there. We worked there for a while. And then pretty soon it was decided that I was going to, since I was a new nurse, I was going to be a surgical nurse, that I would spend most of my time in the surgery. So, on the hospital, I mean on the Oahu they had Scoffield General, Scofield Barracks, which was a big Navy thing, that has been there for centuries and still is, and Tripler General, which is the big Army one. So I was sent -- well, after we were in Kameamea for about not quite two weeks, we were sent to a place called Cocohead, which is now gorgeous, I guess, but at the time it was very primitive. We had -- they were getting us ready for Kwajalein. We had tents to sleep in and mosquito bars, and that was it. Outdoor latrines. You had to come out and walk down to the outdoor latrines on this beautiful island. Anyway, it was very rough. They wanted to get us toughened up, which they did. And the food wasn't that great. You know, you would think we were miles from anything decent. But they, for about -- we were there for about, over two weeks, almost three weeks. And that's when they really worked with us, physical, just hard. That's where they had the swimming, you know. I'm not much of a swimmer but I had to learn to swim. That was a requisite. I mean, you had to definitely be able to -- certain tests you had to make. And I was fortunate. I got out of it in about a week of it because they took me and spent about four or five days at Scofield and four or five days at Tripler. And I know, I remember the Scofield Navy doctor so well because he was so nice. He was an orthopedic, major, colonel or something. And I told him, I said, I don't know anything about amputations. He said, my dear, you are going to have to learn because that's what you're going to be running into. And we really worked on, you know, the linen packs and the surgical packs, the instruments that were needed for amputations, for all that kind of stuff, gunshot wounds. That was -- and I had all that special -- those were the things. I didn't work on like appendectomies and hemorrhoidectomies and his -- all that crap. It was strictly the stuff that the Army would use. He was a wonderful teacher. Then I went -- I went to Scofield first, and then I went to Tripler, and was reinforced with all of it, and scrubbed more or less on more occasions. And then they had me circulating so I would know what the scrub nurses had to have, how to set up the packs, you know, how to feed them to the doctors, the nurses, which was important. I mean, I had to learn that, and I hadn't had any of that. Well, I had training in surgery, but that was it. But like a two-week period, about a week at both. I was glad afterwards. I would have been lost without it. I would have been completely lost, and so would most people. But anyway, from there we finally went down and we flew from there to Kwajalein.
Thomas Swope:
Before we get to that, how long were you in Hawaii? When did you make that crossing? And how long did that take?
Ada Hacker:
Well, we should have figured that out.
Thomas Swope:
Approximately.
Ada Hacker:
I had things, in '43 I was -- in '43, like in December or January, we actually went down at Kwajalein.
Thomas Swope:
January of '44 you went to Kwajalein?
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, actually, yes, went in like in, say, April of '43. Say April, and it was actually in January sometime --
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
I was in Hawaii for over a month, I would say.
Thomas Swope:
Over a month?
Ada Hacker:
I would say over a month in all. I know I spent two weeks at those two special hospitals, and I spent a couple weeks in Cocohead, having to do all the stuff the rest of them had had to do.
Thomas Swope:
So, trained stateside about a year, and then went to Hawaii for a month or so?
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, not quite a year.
Mr. Hacker:
: Tell about the movie about the tree.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yeah.
Thomas Swope:
This is movie is in Hawaii you're talking about?
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, in Hawaii. We had to attend all these movies, and they were telling about what you did if you were ever captured. All you did was: 767501. I will never forget my number, ANC (ph) number, it comes to me before social security or anything. You remembered, you gave your name, rank and serial number. And then nothing else was ever -- we would see horrible movies of people being tortured. And women, they take them away screaming. You could imagine what was next. But then they showed these movies about in this area where we would be going, and they had a lot of hurricanes, tornados.
Mr. Hacker:
: Cyclones.
Ada Hacker:
Cyclones. And all of them had these beautiful palm trees, and they would show them waving down on the ground, and show these natives, and they would go way up high and have this big rope, and they would slap it around the tree and around them, and then they would be on the tree, and then they would go down like this and hit the ground. And all of us sat there. Nobody said anything including the fellows, you know, our men. When it got through, somebody said, we're supposed to do that? And everybody just started laughing like mad. So, when we finally got down, we got in this plane. We had a foot locker, and all of our possessions that we owned was in the foot locker. And we got on the plane, got down there, and you saw this beautiful area. Beautiful area from above, Maturawintoc(ph) and the whole thing. When we landed, we were on the Island of Kwajalein, and it's not one tree, not one blade of grass, nothing left. Our one nurse that was quite a character, she says, oh, thank god, there aren't any trees to worry about. I'll never forget. Everybody just roared, including all the guys that were with us, because we were all thinking of that thing, wondering what would happen. But the other islands were gorgeous still. That was the one that was really thoroughly destroyed. That's the one they wanted to put the airplane, the strip on, and they had to have it so they could go on to Iwo Jima and further. But anyway, we were all going, oh, it's going to feel so good to get a shower. And we were so dirty. Drove in these jeeps and got to our quarters, wooden barracks. Filthy. We looked like raccoons. And our head nurse said, well, now ladies, you can take showers, but I just want to tell you that they will be coldwater salt. I brought some special soap that will make it easier for lathering. We just died. The whole time we were there we had saltwater cold showers. But at least you showered and you got the stuff off. Then you took the towel and wiped the salt off, and that was your shower. You can live through anything if you have to. There's no preference. So, we managed. But our quarters were -- well, Colonel Headwood (ph), that was the head of the whole thing, our colonel. But we had wooden barracks in the center, one way down this way, and it was a shower section, then the latrines opened linoleum (ph) and closed. And this was like a little kitchen type basic down this way, and another latrine at the end of this. As then you first went in, our living room, and you go down like this, and then this way went off of that to the nurse's quarters. Then it was -- we brought along -- you could see on both sides, we could see the ocean, but we didn't look out at it. That was in the back where our living room was. Very basic. No doors. But they had it fixed so that you could not see in direct. And they had a closet that you hang your things. You had a bed, simple bed, a chair and a simple table, and that was it. No curtains or no anything. Oh, and a cot. But they didn't have mosquito bars. You know, we must not have had bugs much because I don't remember being bothered there like other places. But, so we were all anxious then to see what was what. Our showers were very basic, of course, all in one room and cold. And our eating area was the same. We had no refrigeration ever, you know, while we were down there. They took us over then to show us. All the men were in tents, the fellows, and we had a Quonset hut that was our surgery. And of course, right away they got us into what was what and looking around and what-have-you. But we had like four operating room tables. And when we were busy and a bunch of the men flew in, you had them all busy at once. Our corpsmen were very well trained. We had Army corpsmen very well trained, and a lot of Navy and Marine. Marine men who had been -- well, Navy corpsmen, really, who came in and helped too. And they were very good at scrubbing and things like that. And in time, we taught them how to do the shots. They did a lot of the intramusculars as well as the other. But we found out what had to be done. We'd get -- first thing I did was try to check all the equipment, see if there's extra stuff we needed that we knew for what was going to be coming in. And it was pretty well supplied because people had helped supply it in Hawaii, Oahu, you know, that they knew that we would be needing. We did actually have to send back for more supplies as time went by, for like sponges and more linen things. But the basic instruments were the same, and they had a lot of them so that we had plenty to carry us. And saline glucose and the plasma. There was no blood. But fortunately, penicillin had come in, which saved a lot of lives. Every three hours we would have to give the penicillin shots, and practically every guy would get them. I know that's when we trained the corpsmen because you run night duty, only one nurse was on night duty, and every time she would go somewhere, she would have two guys with her accompanying her all over the place. Each ward would have two men, usually one at each end, and they really basically gave most of the shots. The morphine though, I remember, they were very fussy about the morphine. They never wanted it to go in the wrong hands and get waylaid. Occasionally, I guess, some would disappear, and they would wonder about it. But the nurses were more or less responsible for the morphine shots. And at first you were very busy, running around, giving the shots. But the guys were trained to do the other. But you worked. If you had to work 12 hours or more in 24, you did, depending. The first couple of days we were there, it was pretty good, which was fine, because it gave us a chance to get the feel. Then they started coming in, they Aerovaced them in. And you get, I don't know, 30 or 40 at a clip. They would put them like on a hammock type things, bring them in. It was kind of rough because you had to try to decide who was the most crucial that you could save, that you could help and save, and the ones that you could just try to put them out of their agony because you know with their internal injuries, you could tell they weren't going to make it. So anyhow, so why amputate and put them through all that stuff. It was a very hard decision because they were all so young and vital. It was just sad. I just made me sick.
Thomas Swope:
Was that one of your responsibilitis?
Ada Hacker:
Well, in surgery, more or less. More than I wanted it to be. But the doctors, we were all there. The doctors, the corpsmen and myself and this other one, Melba, we were deciding. And we would say, well, look, this one, this one kid they were going to give up on, I said, you know -- they thought he had, his internal injuries were too bad, like the stomach. And we had a little bit of an aside, and I said, what do we have to lose? He will probably die. We went in, and he lived, which was so good. I just felt so -- it made me feel good for months, days, years. And later on this kid, when he was ready -- we used to send some of them, Aerovac them back to Hawaii, and in time the states, and others we had hospital ships that came down to Kwaj. It would take the overflow that they knew they could. The hospital ships were equipped very well with the Navy corpsmen, very well equipped. And those men we put on on that for long term, and then they were admitted when they got back to Oahu or the states, like I said. The other ones we thought were, you know, kind of crucial, and there's a good chance they could make it okay, we Aerovaced them back, so it was a bigger hurry. And this young guy they were going to evac, he had to have an amputation of something, but it was internal, and everybody thought maybe no. And he heard about me, that I was the nurse, and he wanted to talk to me. I still remember going in there. Somebody told him, I don't know, that I helped to save his life, blah blah, blah. And I still remember, I was telling Ed, he was crying and I was crying. And I wish I had gotten his name. I think back on so many of them thinking, I hope he made it. He seemed to be good when he left, but you never know. But he seemed to be so good. He was 19. I was 21, 22, I guess, maybe at that time. But I thought of him so many times. And I think of this other one that was supposed to be so good and everything. We went in one day, and he just quietly died. And I felt bad because I thought he really had a chance. He was married, had just gotten married, and his wife was pregnant when all this started. I think of him so much because he just quietly, which is all right, the way to go, I guess, quietly slept his life away. And, you know, we didn't have time for autopsies and all that stuff. He probably had internal bleeding that was missed. I'm sure that's what happened. And no way could you do -- so they died, you figured that had to be it. You didn't have a chance to pinpoint it when you had so many of them that were -- you always get them in batches. And like I told Ed, I'm not a drinker like some of my friends became, because I was on call basically all the time. And one night not too long after we were there, I was feeling just blue and depressed and everything. And I know they had this little gathering. And I had a couple beers and a thing for a chaser, you know, a shot. I was feeling good. So I went to bed. About two hours after I was in bed, I get the call. Out you went. And I can still remember as vivid as yesterday, for the next at least 12-14 hours working nonstop and just dry-heaving. Every chance I would get I would go out because I was so miserable. And this corpsmen, Reeby (ph), who was so great, master sergeant, he knew more than most of the doctors, a lot of the new ones, anyhow, coming out and holding my head and saying, oh, you know, stick with it. He was so good. I told Ed, he was the one that got my bottle of liquor after that. Every week the nurses and officers were allowed a bottle, and I would give it to him. And the other nurses I would donate, try to give it to my corpsmen in the surgery. Becauase they were so great. I could not operate without them or work without them. So I tried to make sure. And they, of course, shared it. They were good about sharing it. But it kind of put me off drinking, I'll tell you, for a long, long time. And to this day, if I drink beer or wine, I like seltzer water to cut it. But we did have kind of a drinking problem with some of them, which is too bad. And I started smoking there. I didn't smoke all the way through training until I got to Kwaj. They were a nickel a pack. And everybody and their uncle were smoking. I thought gee, I'm missing something. And I started and I thought, oh, well, what's so great about it. But oh, well, that's one of those things that I, fortunately, was able to finish, or not keep up with. The food, besides the coldwater showers, the food was bad. It was all dehydrated, all of it. And we had, well, canned, you know, canned everything, or dehydrated. And we had this hillbilly cook who was really, he was funny, from West Virginia, and he was proud of the fact he was hillbilly from West Virginia, and he let you know it. And we would go in in the morning for breakfast, and you would have this stuff he would have baked, and it would be full. And you would be taking out the little black junk out of it. By the time you got through, the bread was all holey. He would come in and say, oh, come on, ladies, he said, you don't know how hard I worked to collect those little critters. He said, you're not getting the protein you need. I put those in there on purpose. He would go on like that almost every day. Here he comes, you know, taking it out. He was a riot. We had more fun with that man. Different things we would have, he would say, this is really good, I made this especially for you women. But he never cooked before in his life, and he just made career of it. He had the best time being a cook. But that's when the Navy came in because we had a Navy supply ship. And later we had the Navy hospital ship. And Navy supply from the beginning was there. They would eat high on the hog, as they used to say themselves. That was their expression. They got oranges, and they got spam, and they got things that the Army -- people complain about spam, and I said, we were thrilled to death to get spam. And these two flyers that we got quite acquainted with, this Melba and I, we were young. And they had a short shelf life. I said, I wonder what happened to them. I'm afraid they might have been killed even before we left down there. They would would come over, and one of them would a have a can of spam, and the other one would have an orange. So we would take it and divide it. Can you imagine cutting a can of spam? 18 pieces, we take the oranges and cut them. It would be hysterical. We would have more fun doing it. Making sure -- they would each try every time they come, they would say, we know better than to come over here without having something to offer. Then they got so they would ask us to eat. We always had to have two or three in a group. Never alone. We said okay, we'd like to come to eat, sure, but we have to bring friends with us. I said, I have to bring two women with. Why? Well, I said, because I just can't go off with you alone. And Melba would do the same thing. So we ended up, it would be great, about six of us. So, we got so when they were around every week and then, so that we rotated and all the nurses got a chance to eat. And we would eat in the room with the Navy bigshots. Oh, it was fun. They were all dressed up. We were as dressed up as we could be. I just saw this movie not long ago, Mr. Roberts, with--
Mr. Hacker:
: Did you ever see that?
Ada Hacker:
Lemon. And I said from the start, I said to him, what he is trying to happen, won't happen. I have been there. So anyway, they were always trying to get one of us off. And we had more fun. We knew what they were doing, and they knew that we knew what they were doing. Anyhow, it was a fun experience. And they would always make sure that we had an orange, a couple oranges and spam. Including the officers, to take back with us. Like he said, they just had fun meeting and talking to women, you know, and having an experience other than just what they were doing all the time. But --
Mr. Hacker:
: And those two guys took you up in the air.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yes, we had two guys. Oh, they were full of business. A lot of fun, just full of life. And they were both fighter pilots. I think now, like said, I used to get -- and these fighter planes with the open thing. And one time the one went too far. He came down, practically went in the water and went up. I was hysterical. Said, never again. I said, if you do it again, I'm going to report you. Because he was -- he wanted to give me excitement and a thrill. I said, you do that when I'm not in the plane. When I think of even doing it, you know, now, you can tell I was a lot younger. I was an idiot, and didn't know any better. They would go up, you know, just up and around. They probably weren't supposed to do it. I'm sure they weren't. They probably would have gotten in a lot of trouble if the officials had known they were horsing around like that with those planes in the first place.
Mr. Hacker:
: Well, they didn't mind losing the plane or the pilot, but they didn't want to lose a nurse.
Thomas Swope:
Right. Mr. Hacker: Remember? That's what they said.
Ada Hacker:
They said, we can't lose one of the women.
Mr. Hacker:
: They could lose a man but not the nurses.
Ada Hacker:
It was crazy. But anyway, we had a lot of fun. We did have a lot of fun. But the Navy provided it because the poor Army guys, we didn't have that many Army men officers that we were supposed to date, so-called. Most of our men were enlisted, and they were workers. I mean, they worked to maintain things. We did have a black group of CBs (ph) that built the air strip and maintained everything in the harbor, really nice. I know we had a couple of them for patients different times. Really a nice group of men. But there were a lot of Navy and submarine who were based on the ships, but like there was no place to go except our nurse's quarters, and so every once in a while we would have a dance. And they would put -- we'll show you a picture of our floor. We played records.
Mr. Hacker:
: I have pictures __.
Ada Hacker:
We would put records on, and we would all dance. We had one group came through with Carol Landis, I don't think it was Bob Hope, but anyhow, that put on a performance for the guys. And everybody ___ was there. And one night they had some kind of a thing, I and a group of two other women sang this one number, Bugle Corps or one of those peppy dumb songs, and the guys we're going crazy, going wild, you know, probably sounded like sin, but it was the idea that we had the nerve to get up there and do it. We had more fun doing it than anything. We had a kid and a guitar or something, an accompanist. They tried. The guys themselves, they did have movies, enlisted guys. They were the ones we worked with. All of our corpsmen, I got very acquainted with the enlisted guys and found out what kind of life they had and the kind of food. It tickled them that our food was as bad as their. They would make some comment about us eating so great. We told them, and they actually saw it, what we were eating. We were eating the absolute same food. So we weren't treated any different or better than they were. And that made them all happy; okay, the nurses are just like us, they are suffering along with us. They were a really nice group of men. This man here, that's Robert Caesar, was supposed to be in 38th Field, and he lived in Rocky River. He doesn't now. We have a reunion that this man gets us together. I never been to one of them. But I got a letter not long ago again. They were going to have maybe one more because practically everybody has died.
Mr. Hacker:
: Everybody in the Navy.
Ada Hacker:
The letter comes out, and they announce the deaths. This is the last time this one nurse of mine who I had kind of lost track of, her name was listed. It was too bad because out of our 18, we could only keep in touch with like ten or 12. And we tried our best to find out where the others were. And all of us, we went -- you never could -- I thought afterwards, maybe we should have gone through the government better, you know, find out what happened to them. It would have been very interesting to know what happened to them. Because ten or 12, actually 12 of us got together, and I know I had a couple of reunions here at our house. He had to leave, and our kids later on all had to leave, and we turned the house over, and it was really fun. Everybody just yacking away, of course. But when I think about it, if you don't think too much about it, sometimes it seems like it never happened, or it was a fun experience. But then when you think about it, you realize that it wasn't that much fun for anybody really. It was, just like I said, this whole war thing, it's so stupid because it is never going to -- it never cures anything, never. It just makes -- you lose a lot of good people, a lot of good men that should go on to a better life. But it was, it was an experience. You finally, when the war was over, I'll never forget, August 6, I think it was officially, or the bomb was dropped in Japan. It was Janet, ones of the nurse's birthday, and everybody started yelling and screaming. And I was in, you know, in my quarters. I heard all these people yelling and screaming all over the place. Then finally, you know, find out that's what happened. Everybody was so thrilled. Then we stayed on a good two months after that because actually it was around the first of December we actually went, they flew us out, because we had men coming through yet. So we stayed there until around the first of December. See, I wish I had better records. But we were not permitted to say anything in our letters. And this is what I don't understand now when you hear of this, oh, you know, they are writing this story about their experiences. We weren't permitted. We weren't even supposed to keep a diary. And I wish that I could have written it down because I remember letters I wrote to my sister, married sister, brother and my family at home. I have a mother and a sister there. And they were so boring. They would say, you know, it's another hot day. And what's hot? Extremely hot in Kwajalein. Laying there, just water dripping. Dripping off. And in surgery, we would be going around as a circulating nurse, wiping the foreheads of the people working because they were just constant, constant wet. But you couldn't say where you were. That we were in Central Pacific, Marshall Islands, anything. You couldn't -- the first two or three letters came back to me practically ripped, cut out. They had some censor marks. They went through them. They actually went through them. And you weren't to tell anybody where you were or what you were doing. They knew I was in a hospital. I said, well, we're in this small hospital. I said, there's not many nurses. You know, that kind of thing. And then later on, we never did call it a MASH unit, but that's Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. The Koreans came through with that. But we were just a field hospital. They just called it the field, but it was basically a giant emergency room, when you think about it. We basically gave giant emergency treatment to most of our people.
Mr. Hacker:
: They were only there for three days.
Ada Hacker:
Well, usually, yeah. What?
Thomas Swope:
The patients?
Mr. Hacker:
: Tell him about how long the patients stayed there.
Ada Hacker:
Generally they would stay about three days before they would be Aerovaced out or put on the ship, because there would be new people coming in. We were so busy. Not too long after we actually landed, set up for Iwo Jima, and that the one that was so hideous, Iwo Jima, and then we had Okinawa and then Saipan, Guam. After Saipan was secured then they put a bigger hospital up, a general hospital down there. And that's when it started easing off for us. But Iwo Jima was so bad. Well, they had a lot of deaths. And they would ship them. They shipped them home for burial. And that's what the ships were used for. And then the ones, the long-term patients they thought could manage, they would put on that. And they would be filled going through. They would stop and pick up some of our people, but they had so many bodies, it was just terrible.
Mr. Hacker:
: Tell him about the swimming.
Thomas Swope:
So the first casualties were coming from Iwo Jima you think?
Ada Hacker:
Basically, yes.
Thomas Swope:
So you must have got there in early '45, in Kwajalein.
Ada Hacker:
No, this it was in '44, I think.
Thomas Swope:
Well, Iwo Jima was February of '45, yeah.
Ada Hacker:
'45? Okay. Well, then -- whenever it was then.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, and Guam. Okay. Wait a minute. We had people. Where would we have gotten them from. We started setting up people when we were in Marshall -- I should look that up. I have these letters a couple places but where are they. Oh, you said about swimming. Somebody said you probably went swimming, but we didn't because the bodies, there were bodies floating up out of the water. Still from the Kwajalein battle. And most of them were Japanese but occasionally you get an American, which was sad, that would actually come up. Then when we first got there the stench was so bad. And we find found out it was the bunkers, that they had built these bunkers all over. And they wouldn't come out, and they would just shoot at our guys. And eventually they'd throw the grenades in there in the holes, and that would be the end of them. And then you had to wait a while. And after we were there, they spent a lot of time cleaning out the bunkers, and the smell got better. But as long as there was a couple in the bunkers yet, you had the smell that hung over anything. So that was another reason I would never drink the water. And they had it, had it that supposedly you could drink, but there was so much stuff floating. I still don't know how they did it or how they treated it to take water from an ocean, saltwater, and made it palatable. Now, they used it for cooking, and of course we showered. I remember this one sergeant hated beer. Oh, he said, no way. So, he had drank some water, and he didn't like it, so somebody said, you got to try it. So he took a clean sock and filtered it through. And we all saw that carp (ph) and he almost heaved on the sight. He said, okay, I guess I'll learn to drink beer. Like me, he started drinking hot beer. To this day I like hot, warm better. But I'll never forget that sock. Oh. People just didn't drink beer -- I mean, didn't drink water. I never liked -- I never drank beer, but I started, developed a taste for it, like everything else. What was the other thing?
Mr. Hacker:
: You had R&R _____.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yeah, after the war. But, yeah, after the air we had a four or five-day thing up in Hawaii on the Island of Hawaii where the volcano is, and it was inactive, and it was so interesting. They had it set up. We would walk out along the rim and walk down parts of it. It just fascinates me when I think about it. It hadn't been active for years and years and years. And now, of course, the whole area is completely out. But the whole R&R, we went in there, and we would stand under the shower for like a half hour at a time and not want to get out and do anything else. Just stand under the shower. I know what I was going to tell about this, we had a Navy man. Oh, he was supposed to be a high-up in the Navy, that they captured. And our men just got so furious. They said, why do we have to take care of this, you know, and go on and on and on. And he acted like he didn't understand a word of English the whole time. And he was so inscrutable. Their faces, you know, just don't give a thing a way. And finally, oh, he was there about, oh, quite a while because they said they want him alive. They want to ship him back to Washington as soon as they can, you know, get him there. And he had pretty serious injuries to start with, but they did keep him there. People flew in there to talk to him. The day he was leaving, I was on night duty. And that morning they said he wants to talk to the nurse, the nurse, the nurse, and so I go on up there, and he says, "Thank you, Lt. Lucas, for excellent service given," in perfect English. Of course, then he smiled. He actually smiled. Because all of our faces, you know, were just, we were just struck dumb. I guess somebody said, the rumor afterwards, that he had been educated in the states. Very well educated. But thank you, Lt. Lucas, for excellent service given. I'll never forget that. It was really an experience. We said, you can smile. I remember saying, you can smile. He was smiling again because he caught us all, and it tickled him so much. That was an experience. He was taking everything in that was going around. You know, all the horrible jazz, what they would do to him, boy, if this guy wasn't, you know, saved, I used to say, this one guy was determined he was going to do away with him. I said, listen, I know exactly who will be responsible if something happens to him. They realized it was serious and we couldn't let anything happen to him, not on our shift anyway. But that was fascinating to hear. I'll never forget him. He absolutely had no look ever. Just completely blank like he just didn't know what has happening all around him, and he wasn't missing a trick. It was -- it was an experience, the more I think about it. The food was bad. I got so I was drinking coffee with skim milk or canned milk when I got home. I couldn't stand regular cream in my coffee. It took me the longest time to get used to cream. Then I just started drinking it black, and it was easier. It was really weird how can you get used to things if you have to. But fresh fruit was really so important. I mean, you just -- oh, I don't know.
Thomas Swope:
You probably didn't treat a whole lot of prisoners, there, I assume.
Ada Hacker:
No, that's the only one I remember that they were trying to save. You know, a patient. He had some kind of a gunshot wound, I remember. No, we didn't. Now, they might have stayed on ship, or they might have been done away with quietly. I tell you, the feeling was very strong. The Japanese -- the Germans were like us, but the Japanese were inhuman. This was the feeling. And they would reinforce it with the movies they would show. I have to be honest. They got this so that we all felt that we weren't dealing with really human people. The way they would do the suicide bombings and the suicide things, it made them -- they didn't care about life, theirs or anyone else's. And so you kind of felt that they were like inhuman compared to the way we felt about things. But they didn't bother with taking prisoners unless they were high up, important. They didn't bother with them. Somebody just managed to make sure something happened to them, and they went back as a body. We didn't -- oh, we sent an awful lot of bodies back, unfortunately.
Thomas Swope:
Did your hospital ever come under attack?
Ada Hacker:
No, not actually. But they said it could have many times, especially when we were first down there. See, we didn't have electricity, which was big problem, later -- which was a help. Later on we did, we did get some electricity. But when we first went down there, there wasn't any. Because they said -- well, hmm, did we get it?
Mr. Hacker:
: Must have had portable for the operating.
Ada Hacker:
Our hospital was set up, definitely. We were the ones that had it. Nobody else had it. They didn't have refrigeration anywhere. Because that's what the cook used to complain. He would say, if I could have some kind of refrigeration, I would give you, you know, you ladies really good meals. And he had a point. He said -- of course, where are you going to get the stuff to work with? You know, they weren't growing anything. We could not go -- after the war, people would go over to Majura (ph). And we talked too, at that time, we could pick up things and get all this, what do they call, plantain, the stuff that would grow in the field. What's the other one they just pick off the trees? That was so good. Oh. They had a lot of that exotic type fruit of, and it was wonderful. We got it and would bring it back. They'd take us over in the landing ships. I remember going over. They get you pretty close, then we had to get out and wade. By the time we get there, we would be sopping wet. I remember, they should give us some boots to put up to our knees because we just had our uniform. And we always had dresses at that time. Later on, in Korea they gave the nurses slacks that matched their outfits, the brown and white nurse's outfits. But we didn't. I can still remember. Oh, and then after a few minutes, you got used to it. Before you knew it, you were dry, and then if you take your shoes and socks off, you were dry. And it didn't matter. We would do that every time. And the people were so neat. They loved it when we came. Majura (ph). A lot of them had been shipped. The Army or somebody had taken a lot of them off of Kwajalein. I don't know when they were removed, when it first started or what, ___ that more of them weren't killed, the native people who lived on the island. They were all moved to Majura. And they hated losing it but they knew otherwise they would be killed. But they thought we were great. We were their salvation. The Germans had come in first and taken over that area. And then after World War 1, it was given to Japan, and they came in and took over the area. Between the two of them, apparently it was pretty good. But they ended up with a lot of venereal diseases, gonorrhea one of the worst. It was sad because three-fourths of the people on the island had picked it up and it had kept on going and it hadn't been treated. So we would go over like once a week, and it was a fun day. Go over and eat all this good fruit and all this stuff and give shots and shots and shots and shots, you know, and ____ with the little kids and everything, and there would usually be four of us that got to go over. I went over at least three times and just had a ball. I have a picture, holding one of the little babies. But it was getting away from that island and seeing how beautiful the place really was. I said, someday I'd liked to go back there. It's supposeded to be gorgeous now. One of the nurses, Maxine, had a pilot friend who went, had dropped there, stopped off at Kwajalein, and he had been in that area, and he could not get over how nice. He had come back. He said it was just like it should be. But I don't know.
Thomas Swope:
Did you have to treat many cases of venereal disease in your field hospital?
Ada Hacker:
Not really, no. Our fellows were pretty much watched. They were issued condoms. Basically that was it. They had a GI issue. Whether they wanted them or used them or gave them away or whatever, they didn't care. But whenever any of them, when we were in the islands or the states, they had to take the condoms with them. Whether they used them, like I said, somebody said, sell them to one of your friends, you know. This is an issue, you take this with you. Three-fourths of them, I think, used them, and that was it. But no, we didn't. Maybe later on at Nichols they had cases. You know, in the long terminal hospitals. That I think is still, you know -- Nichols, when we were there, we first were getted acquainted, we had a great time because every weekend the guys from Fort Bragg would come up, and there would be a bunch of them, and a whole bunch of us would go in, like about eight or ten of us would go in from our group. And the other, not just from our group. And we would go to the good bars where they had the good music and the peppy stuff. We would have more fun. I remember having a beer. Yeah, two or three that were noted for their good dancing. They had a disk jockey and they would be playing records, all these real popular good records, Benny Goodman, Harry James, and those real good people at the time. And I had started jitterbugging in high school. So it was fun. And three or four of us, we just had a ball. We would dance with the sailors, all the guys that were in there. It was just a good evening. Nobody had dates. We just all mixed and danced on the dance floor. Somebody said then that the civilians would be glad when we left so they could come back and own their city again because between Fort Bragg and the nurses, they basically took over Louisville during that period. But it was nice. And I know it wasn't too far from -- where is the place where the horses. We used to --
Thomas Swope:
Kentucky Derby?
Ada Hacker:
We used to pass that, the Kentucky Derby place, on the way from Nichols into the downtown area. I know, so it wasn't real far. I'll tell just one more thing, and that's it about the Navy.
Mr. Hacker:
: The Navy guy?
Ada Hacker:
When I was in Louisville right after I got there.
Mr. Hacker:
: Very naive.
Ada Hacker:
Very naive. Extremely so. And this major, oh, he came on me, he was always so friendly and nice, and finally he asked me for a date. I said fine. Sunday afternoon. And go into the hotel, I guess we were going out for dinner, lunch, I don't know. So he picks me up, and on the way in he stops, oh, this guy would like a ride. Do you mind if we bring him? I said, sure, fine. Turns out it's another major, a friend of his. So we go in, really nice hotel. Beautiful hotel in the town. I guess we ate like a dinner there. It was like on a Sunday. And then the friend left. Okay. And then after about ten minutes my date, oh, he was going to go out for a few minutes. So, the guy that's the waiter, he knew what was going on. He came over. He was really nice. Just visited with me, got me another drink, asked me all about where I was from, and kept me occupied. And after a while my date came back, and the other guy didn't right away. So later on then, we started out, oh, here is my friend, picks him up and brings him back. Turns out, of course, the friend was a patient at our hospital, and he was a homosexual. Of course, it turned out that the major, who is in the major adjutants general, was also homosexual. He had gotten in the habit of doing this. He got the new naive young ones that didn't know, get them for a date, take one or two of the other guys, you know, from the psycho ward, the homo. Of course, a lot of them were fine, maybe they were really homo. But then it was considered, oh, my gracious, you couldn't keep them in the Army. I never knew if he got found out or not. But I came back, and I was just feeling so great about myself, a date, boy, with two majors. I started telling these nurses. Two of them were the older ones from Lutheran, and they started laughing like mad. Jean, you got caught, you got caught. And they went on and on. Apparently one or two of them had gone through the same process and found out afterwards that he wanted to have a a blind, and he always managed to pick up one or two of the guys on the way. They wanted to go and thety would have it worked out ahead of time. And I'm sure he had it worked out with the guy at the hotel, who knew exactly what was going on. He was so friendly. He would bring drinks and kept me talking about things so the time, you know, I wouldn't sit there. But it was clever. And they laughed, and they would go on about how many times that had happened. Two of the women stayed there, but they said, we never said anything. We always wait for one of the new ones to come back and tell us. Because they usually come back and start bragging about their date with these two majors. And then they told them. They said, if we thought it was dangerous or bad, we would have, you know, told you. They got a kick out of waiting to see who was the next victim, what would happen. They really got a kick out of that. I thought to myself, oh, brother, me and my big proudness that I am having a date with two majors out there. I'll never forget.
Thomas Swope:
So, to recap, this guy would take a nurse out on a date so people would not suspect anything.
Mr. Hacker:
: A blind.
Ada Hacker:
Exactly.
Thomas Swope:
A blind. Then he would be meeting somebody else?
Ada Hacker:
Yes.
Thomas Swope:
You would be occupied while they -- whatever?
Ada Hacker:
Usually the guy would be, he would not come to -- right in the beginning, be in the car in the beginning. He would pick him up, oh, he's probably looking for a ride into town, let's give him a lift. That kind of thing. That's what he did that day.
Thomas Swope:
Instead of all three of you going out.
Ada Hacker:
Exactly. Then he would usually, well, he would usually bring them back with him, drop him off ahead of time. And this guy would go back in the hospital where he was a patient in the psych ward.
Thomas Swope:
How did this patient get out of the hospital?
Ada Hacker:
Oh, they had leaves. They could definitely have leave during the day, and Sunday especially. Saturdays and Sundays, a lot of them have family, want to go to church.
Mr. Hacker:
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, and he was in the adjutant general's office in Louisville. He had a lot of power and lot of pull. This one Pearl (ph), one of the women from Lutheran was stationed there. And she said not too long after we left, he left. She said, I think somebody finally found out what he was doing because, she said, he just kind of disappeared. One day he wasn't there. So somebody maybe blew the whistle or, who knows, or he thought himself he better see about getting transferred out. But it was really interesting. I thought, boy, there was homosexuality, it's been around forever. And it was in the service, but it used to be such a hideous, horrible crime, that if you were, you never admitted to it because you could be kicked out immediately.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Yeah, real quick. And there was never any ifs or butts about it like now. And you know doggone well it occurred. But that's life. But this man, oh. He was a very nice looking, very personable person. It just tickled me. I never saw him afterwards, and I always thought, I'd like to go back and just talk to him and ask if he had a really good day with his friend that day. But I never had occasion. He was in the office, he wasn't near the hospital part. So he managed to get -- but they said what he would do, look over the new crop that would come in, pick one of the young ones that he figured would not be hanging around, would be moving out quick. And that's exactly what he did, because most of them did. And my friend Pearl, she used to want to leave so bad. And I said to her this one time, why don't you see if you can get a date, you know, finagle a date with him. And then he left, she said, too soon. She kept saying, oh, I would have gone up and asked him to take me out Sunday. Because she wanted to leave the area. She was so disgusted because she spent the whole time there without leaving to go anywhere. And a lot of them went to Europe. But I would say most of us went Pacific somewhere. Usually central by that time. But --
Thomas Swope:
Did you say Melba was your best buddy?
Ada Hacker:
Melba was one of them. We picked her up at Camp Campbell. We had these two, and one was Parrine, who was a little on the chubby side, and she was a little older. We went to Camp Campbell, and she said right off the bat, I want to stay in the Army, but I can't hack this stuff.
Mr. Hacker:
: Climbing the ropes ___.
Ada Hacker:
Climbing on the ropes, crawling on the belly. Not the stomach; you crawl on the belly. It was too much. It was hard for all of us. That's why they had us doing all the calisthenics and all the lifting. Lifting the guns, which almost knocked you over. When you shot them, they really blew you back. But the hardest part of all was climbing that dumb rope, straight up and down on the side of a building. And we had to climb it. And they had a rope that you would grab it. But none of us could grab it with our foot and go up this way. It was arranged so that you didn't. It was horrible. And I would think, oh, I can't go down. I would fall to the ground, and that would be the end of me. You kept on going, and get to the top. Never been so happy in my life that I made it. I didn't think I would. The same way with crawling on your belly. People would say, I'm crawling on my stomach, and the sergeant would say you are crawling on your belly. This is the belly, not the stomach. And keeping your head down. You had to remember to keep your head down. And it was supposedly live ammunition. Maybe it wasn't, and they told us that. It was enough to make us keep our heads down, you know, and crawl the best we could. But it was always toughening. Like I said, they got you used to the idea of outdoor toilets, lousy food, you know, in Kwajalein. And I said, here among this island, I've never been back, this beautiful Island of Oahu, and I said, that's where we swam, Cocohead. Beautiful beach. But when we went back to, back to the basic old Cocohead, which was at like Kwajalein, you know, by that time they didn't give us any fancy place like when we first arrived. It was fun. We would get together and talk about these things. Somebody would say, I don't know how I did it. Of course, they were all young. We had a couple like in their 30s, Melba -- I mean Hannah. She was. And she was like the mother hen to us. She was the one that got so upset about us going up in this plane. She said, I'm going to report you to the authorities if you don't cut out that kind of stuff, you know. And she would say every once in a while about different dates and all. But she knew we were -- the airplane was the only thing that really got her upset. We would have these parties, and it would be fun because nobody was dating. And these two sergeants we supposedly dated, we would have a ball. If they took us up in the plane, that would be it. But usually we managed to get everybody else too and go out on their boat a lot or their ships. We would have dances. Where are those pictures? Show them that just real quick. I'm going to keep quiet. We have a picture on the Kwajalein. It's very basic, what was built. Show you how basic it is. Yeah, our quarters name, it was Hell's Bells. Yeah.
Thomas Swope:
Looking ___+?
Ada Hacker:
The one is, let's see, the one is the whole group of us.
Thomas Swope:
_____+?
Ada Hacker:
Yeah. Down below, we had this sergeant that exercised us all the time. He liked me. It was very obvious to everybody. And in the morning he would call roll and he would say, Lt. Smith, you know, whatever, and then he would say, Lt. Ada Lucas. That was my official first name. And everybody would laugh, you know, everybody thought that was so funny. So, after about three times I said to him, I'm going to report you to the authorities if you keep that Ada. But he was always looking at me. And the guys in the group -- we would all be doing it together, the other corpmens that we were working with would go on and on about him. Ada, you know, boy, Ada, too bad you're a lieutenant. They just had fun. It was just a fun thing to do. Basically, we worked with our corpsmen but you never, ever dated any of them. That was just -- I guess it just kept things easier, you know, really, especially when there were so few nurses. It's better that we didn't. And the men that we dated were in and out. And you didn't get -- although one of our nurses managed to get pregnant toward the very end. And she was a favorite of our head nurse, who would go with her to the colonel's place. Our head nurse and the colonel. And the colonel had -- you know, major whatever. And she got pregnant. It was funny. She was there, and all at once, one day she was gone. Everybody said, you know, where is Tendle (ph), where is Tendle. And later it filtered back, which was too bad. I always felt bad about it because she was kind of a sitting duck. Sophie always, you know, thought she was so great, and I think she thought it, and all of a sudden she realized she was in a situation she really wasn't happy about probably. But too bad.
Mr. Hacker:
: Tell him about your appendix.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, I had my appendix out when I was over there.
Thomas Swope:
In Kwajalein?
Ada Hacker:
Yeah. This major, who was a new -- I think he came out of med school to go in the Army. He operated on me. And oh, it was terrible. This Melba scrubbed, and she says, it took like three hours to get my appendix out. And that should be done in like 20 minutes if you're good. He had my gut out all over the table. And she said she actually like was dry-heaving because it was so bad. I was laid up for a while because I was so miserable with gas and everything. I was starting to remember the gas pains I had from that thing and everything. On the way back on the Lurelaine, when the time was to leave Hawaii, we had the chance to come on the Lurelaine again or fly. Right away I said the Lurelaine. And there were three that chose it, the three that didn't get seasick. And right after we took off, this Navy young guy got ill with appendix. And the report went out, the Navy guy said, I hear there's nurses on board who would scrub. And I said yes, I would love to. And it was so much fun. They had this beautiful surgery on this Navy ship, or on this ship, laid out. And I swear, from the time we started, this kid was in and out in a half hour. Just really bang, bang, bang, knew what he was doing. Melba was telling him, and he said, who operated, a corpsman? You know, I said no. He said, well, I'm glad to see you're alive and still here with us, you know. This man, you know, it was sad. A lot of them joined just right out of internship. They all served like a year. I felt sorry for a lot of them because a lot of them didn't have experience in surgery. They had it some, but not like they would have needed then when they were starting to do amputations and gunshot wounds. It was more advanced. And a lot of them learned on the job. It's that simple. They learned on the job. Just like I basically learned the surgery, like I said, I'm so glad we had that extra training to know it. I had a wonderful sergeant, this Reeby (ph) who had been there, he knew what it was like, he had been in the service before, and he was wonderful. He backed us out. He, in fact, when I left there, he made a new footlocker for me, that's what -- wooden, that I gave my daughter. Really neat wooden foot locker. But he was such a salvation. Just unbelievable. If we had had somebody that didn't know their stuff or was uncooperative, it could have been a miserable experience. He was so good, and every corpsman that came under him, he trained them, basically, the rights and the wrongs of the whole business. He was a pleasure to work with, he really was. Of course the Army, the officers, doctors, some of them came in kind of thinking they were all better than the rest of us because they were a doctor. But you know most of them got, before long, they realized they didn't know that much, and they relied on this Reeby (ph) a lot, you know, to help them. They would try to manage to scrub on some of them when they knew they were going to be bad. I can remember him scrubbing and me circulating on stuff, that he really helped the doctor and got him going in the right direction, which was the salvation. He was the first one, this one. We had another one that was pretty --
Mr. Hacker:
Ada Hacker:
Yeah. We had -- who was really nice, an older man. Dinkle, Dr. Dinkle (ph). I said older. He was probably in his late 40s, early 50s. That was older to me. But he knew what he was doing. He was a very competent man. He taught everybody. You know, he taught us all. I think -- no, he was in the Army. He just joined the Army But he had a lot of surgery experience. And that's what was needed because that's basically what we did. We didn't take care of people who were ill. You know, you took care of people who had to have -- gunshot wounds, internal injuries from stepping on grenades. Some of them, unfortunately if they didn't -- well, that's where most of it happened, when they stepped on stuff or something was thrown at them, that they would lose -- or they would pick up something -- a hand or leg or arm, hands, arms, legs and feet. And then they get hit. Well, three-fourths of those people, unfortunately, died right off the bat, which is better than having them live and being in agony. But a lot of them did, the internal injury cases. They would throw stuff or have things partially exploded, and people would pick them up. You know, they would pick them up. Well, you know, when you're in the middle, they would tell about it, these fellows, they would say, it's hell. It's hell, just hell. You know, I don't want to talk about it. Or they would start rambling, and they'd keep saying, it's hell, it's just hell. They said, I never thought I would be here to see anybody again. Most of them went in, and seeing people die around them, thought they would never make it. That they got back, they felt grateful they were at the place where they were. They really had a reason to, when you think about it. It's horrible conditions that they put these guys to, when you think about it. Just like now.
Thomas Swope:
You said most of these guys went in and out in a few days. Did you end up getting close to any of the other patients?
Ada Hacker:
Not too much. As well as you could. See, I worked -- that's why when I got out of the service, they wanted me to work at Lutheran in surgery. I said no. I said, I want to work with people, I want to be with people. I worked in surgery. I had to spend my -- I had to spend like a month, about every three to four weeks on night duty. That was my turn. And that's when I got acquainted with the people. If I had worked every day in the wards, I would have gotten acquainted. But we would get them in, we would get them out, we would get them in and we would get them out. I would see them briefly. That's why this one time, this one kid, they weren't going to do anything with him, they kind of put him -- we had wards. And you kind of try to keep them isolated. These are the really criticals. Probably won't make it. These are the ones that we think, well, okay, there's a hope for them, and we got to get at them as soon as we can. You didn't take your time operating on the ones that had the internal stuff because you knew you weren't going to help them anywhere or save them. Maybe if they didn't have internal injuries you could save them. You had to kind of -- it was sad. What else could you do.
Thomas Swope:
Was there -- I don't know if you had the nurses to spare, but was there anyone with the guys when they knew they weren't going to do anything?
Ada Hacker:
Yes. Yes, they had people with them all the time, nurses and other corpsmen. So they weren't alone. And if they were able to talk, they always encouraged people to be there so they could talk. And some of them did until that was it. That's when it got so sad. This one day though, this young kid that had been bad, and then we decided to help him and save him and operate on him, and he made it, and somebody said something about the nurse in surgery is responsible for you, otherwise you probably would have not made it, or, you know, made some comment. And he was going to go out, and he wanted on see. He said, I want to talk to that nurse. And it's the only time I actually got to, besides the Japanese man, he was the only one I actually talked to. Too many of them I didn't get a chance to visit with. I really didn't. Not in Hawaii. In Hawaii later on, after we went back, I didn't because working nights, I was running around giving shots and IV's, and glucose and saline, you know, just on the go constantly. If I had been there every day in the wards, I would have gotten friendly with them in the two or three days they were there. They tried to get them out as quick as they can, on a plane or aboard ship. When I went back afterwards, we went back. I got out of the service January 16th or something officially. And I was discharged. Had pneumonia, by the way, ended up out at the Veterans Hospital, and I was smoking. And the doctor said to me, you're smoking. I said, yes. He says, well, if you want to have a short life, keep on smoking. Young lady, if you don't want to live longer or have a short life. I remember thinking, you old drip, you know, but he was probably in his 40s, and knew what he was talking about. But when we were at the 224th, this Kameamea place, we worked on the floor. I could have -- I worked earlier, but I didn't want -- I worked with people. And they were all surgical, getting back. And we ran across -- I did work in surgery a little bit, now that I think about it. The woman was Chinese and was getting married, and she was an anesthesiologist. And Melba and Hannah were invited to her wedding and I was too, so I must have been on surgery part too. I'm sure I was. Anyway, we three were invited to her wedding, and she was marrying a genuine Hawaiian. And it was so delightful. I told him, the experience itself was so great. Because they had -- it was a typical --
Mr. Hacker:
: Hawaiian wedding.
Ada Hacker:
They had all the dances. But they had this Poi, we kept hearing about Poi, and they had one finger, two finger, three finger Poi, and uou took according to how thick it was. We had more fun doing this, eating this. And they had several barbecued pigs. The food was delicious. We got a chance to actually visit with native people, and they visited with us. They were so nice to us because they were friends of this girl. And she made a point of introducing us to everybody, saying these are my nurse friends, you know, from the hospital. And people came up to us and talked. And it was such a neat experience. I often thought that was just one of the best things of the whole thing. Because we were able to, when we went back to Hawaii, it was such a relaxed time. The war was over. People were just happy, let's put it that way. This Hawaiian guy, he did something. He was a full-blooded. They kept saying, full-blooded Hawaiian. And he was marrying a Chinese. His relatives, were probable thinking, oh, my, no more full-blooded. There is such a mixture there, just like everywhere else. But in a way, I tried not to think about this for years. He got on this business of writing my history. And he made me start thinking and going back and remembering and trying to put things in sequence. I had thought of things that I haven't thought of in years. And I wake up at night. I have had dreams, some things really vivid, and I can see it just in front of me. And I wake up, and it's a dream, and just like it just happened. But it's in there somewhere. But it's just like it just happened. It just amazes me. I think we have every -- all of us are like that.
Thomas Swope:
When you think about that, is there one particularly vivid memory that comes to mind?
Ada Hacker:
Oh, I don't know. Quite a few. I still remember seeing the movie with the lashing to the trees, and everybody having hysterics all the way down there on that plane. Just different things. And about the coldwater salt. Realizing the food was so bad. Yeah, the pressure of the surgery. You were always under pressure. I always felt I was always under pressure, because you were on duty or you were off duty. When I was on duty, there's always stuff to do. Make up packs, make sure instruments were clean. Because we used stuff so fast, so even if you weren't operating, you had things to do. Making sure you had enough sponges and supplies and saline and glucose. It was a constant thing that you had to see about, and ordering stuff. It went on and on and on and on.
Thomas Swope:
You sterilized the equipment?
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yeah, we had autoclaves, absolutely. We had surgery. I know they didn't -- people said, oh, you had ice cream. The Navy had ice cream. Looking forward to the meals on the Navy ship. The fact we were allowed to take the nurses, nurse friends with us, made it nice. Because we would not have gone if we hadn't been allowed. We would not have felt right if we couldn't have taken them with us. But thinking back, this case about the young kid wanting to thank me, and this case about seeing this other one that had died, and this case about the Japanese man, different things come out. Different ones come out. During surgery we had a couple of crucial things. It was horrible when they died when you had them on the table. And you would think they were going to be all right, but then that would be it. In those days, you didn't take the time. You could not do all the resuscitation. You didn't have the whole blood. You didn't have the facilities they have now. We couldn't have saved them. They would have needed constant care we couldn't have given them. We didn't have room for them. We had no intensive --
Thomas Swope:
Intensive care?
Ada Hacker:
Intensive care units. And you think now, if they had this, a lot of them would have been saved. Like in Korea, some of them were saved, and now the Vietnam War, some of them were saved that would have died in WWII. Now, I read, and I have to find out more about it, they have a new patch, that's a new patch that is impregnated with some kind of material that when they can put it down into the wound, say you have a chest wound, they put it into the wound, and it stays there, and it stops the bleeding almost immediately. It starts to heal. You don't remove it. I have to find out more about it. I heard about it just the other day again. They said it was a godsend. They have been working on it. And this experience now in this war, they are using it for the first time ever, and how wonderful it's working out. And you think, well, that would have saved many lives. You know, each war, just like the penicillin. So many of those men would have died from gunshot wounds, especially the emergency staff that brought them around. The corpsmen were so busy. They couldn't go around and be giving penicillin shots with all the other stuff. So they had to come to like a surgical emergency room, which is what the field hospitals and MASH units are, when it comes right down to it. Then you have to move along for further long care. Some of them probably had setbacks. I'm sure they did after they left us. When we actually got them on the planes, they were alive. Actually put them on the ships, they were alive. But we did put a lot of bodies on the ships, unfortunately. They would not have Aerovacced them. We had to put them on the ships and take them back because they would die after they got to our place.
Mr. Hacker:
: When you came back, they wanted to put you in surgical. She wouldn't do any surgical. Tell him about the Shepherd stuff.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, that's, well, I worked with an osteopathic hospital with the Shepherds. They were really nice. I didn't know Sam because he was still in training, OB training out west, but his father and Steven, he was the kidney doctor that I worked with, they were lovely people. And I worked downtown at 32nd and Euclid, then and later they moved out to the Bay Village. And they were so great, and from the beginning I said, that man could never have done -- killed his wife. His family was so nice. I never met him.
Thomas Swope:
You didn't know both of them?
Ada Hacker:
I knew his wife. I met the older man.
Thomas Swope:
You knew Marilyn?
Ada Hacker:
Oh, no, I did not know Marilyn and I did not know Sam.
Mr. Hacker:
: Just Steve.
Ada Hacker:
I knew Steve, the doctor I worked with, and Richard, he was the older one. I met him, Steven and his wife, and the parents I met. And those four people were just lovely. And Richard. You know, it just blows my mind to this day that he was accused because this whole technique was so sloppy and so lousy, it's just a crime what happened there. It killed his parents. Really did. I mean it just -- well, anyway, they were great people. And Steven especially wanted me to work in surgery because he did a lot of kidney work. But I worked basically a lot of times as special for him. I would be like their intensive care nurse, I would work with them and stay there.
Mr. Hacker:
: Didn't they stay in intensive care?
Ada Hacker:
Not those days. I stayed like 12 hours with them, the bad ones. And then we tried to get a special nurse in, which they had a lot of them in those days. I would stay with a lot of them, his severe cases, right away. No, that is basically what I did all the time. I didn't actually work with the people that were talking. They were people that were ill, you wouldn't visit with. That's what was nice when I went to work at Lutheran. I worked on the fourth floor, they had surgery in this section, and this was the fourth floor medical. And it was so much fun. We had this big eight-bed ward with women. A lot of them, unfortunately, had broken hips and things like that. We had so much fun. One of them had the bell on, you would go in, and it would take you an hour to get it out because you wanted to take care of this, then this and do that. And they would go around and say, okay, whose turn is it to go in the eight-bed. But we had a circus with those women. They were lonely and they wanted to visit. But it was fun with me just visiting with them and seeing the people and visiting with them. It was fun. No, they kept after me the whole time I was there to work in surgery. We're short today, we're short today, we need somebody, go on and on. They were always short.
Mr. Hacker:
: She had enough of that.
Ada Hacker:
They always need people. Hospitals, to this day, are short everywhere, and they will be forever. They were even back then when they had a lot more nurses than they do now.
Mr. Hacker:
: She recruits nurses.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, boy.
Mr. Hacker:
: It's a tough job.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, it's a horrible job. It's so bad because you get them and they work so -- the good ones really put in long hours. And they are consciencious, and they hate not doing things and being sloppy, you know, just leaving things undone. Makes you feel horrible. -- I was in a bad, horrible, near-fatal accident in '87. And boy, I tell you, I was in the hospital 29 days. I had a lot of nurse's experience. And in the beginning I was having -- I had four -- five broken ribs because the CPR, they kept bringing me back, kept dying. But I had a broken tibia and fibula and crushed ankle, all sorts of things. And so, I was really in a lot of pain. But it was about four days before I knew I had all these other casts on because of breathing problems. And finally, they weren't giving me enough medicine. I can still remember, I was carrying on. I said, what are you doing? You nurses taking the shots instead of giving it to the patients? I accused them of everything. I didn't care at that point. And I could hear them say, that bitch in there is a nurse. I could hear them going on. The next day the doctor goes, I said, I want to go to the Betty Ford Clinic. I'll take the cure afterwards. I need the shot now. They finally got me, here is your medication. But I was just in agony. I said it then, you have to raise a fuss if you're in the hospital and you're suffering. Don't be quiet and not say anything. I was horrible, just like the worst patients we ever had that I never was going to be like. I guess if you're hurting enough, you will do it. You know, I think of those days. Those nurses just loved me.
Mr. Hacker:
: You know, it's funny, you asked me in the beginning with her words, what you did here with her, we spent about three weeks. A little bit of this, little of this, and it wasn't in the right sequence.
Ada Hacker:
I know. Ed, that's because it got more in my mind better.
Mr. Hacker:
: Well, as we have gone through it.
Ada Hacker:
He keeps bringing up things now. There's still a lot of things I know I have forgotten or missed out completely in sequence, but basically, you know, that's it. I think most all the nurses that were in MASH units had the same experience no matter what. It was bad situations. You put up with what you had, and it was not nice. Europe the same way, I'm sure it was. The general hospitals are different, but it was hard work.
Mr. Hacker:
: And if you want, her official name is Ada Jean.
Ada Hacker:
Ada. Ada.
Thomas Swope:
That's what's listed on the thing. Ada Jean Lucas.
Ada Hacker:
Can I see that a minute? I don't know. What are you giving him, Ed?
Thomas Swope:
What's the difference between a field and an evacuation hospital?
Ada Hacker:
Well, I don't know. I don't know at this area, at this point. Maybe it's the same thing.
Thomas Swope:
The other nurse I talked to was with the 34th Evac in Europe.
Ada Hacker:
That could be. That could be. It could be the same. I know we were fields, and all of us, all the ones in our area were called field. But evacuation, that sounds like --
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
It sounds -- maybe in Europe they call them evacs. Very well, very well could have called them that.
Mr. Hacker:
: Unless they are the ones that got the patients first to put them on the plane to come to her.
Thomas Swope:
Possibly.
Ada Hacker:
Maybe she was the first contact and Jean was the second.
Thomas Swope:
Well, she, yeah, she was moving a lot.
Ada Hacker:
Thomas Swope:
In fact, at one point they were ahead of the front lines.
Ada Hacker:
Well, yes, in Europe that happened.
Thomas Swope:
Yeah.
Ada Hacker:
In Europe that definitely happened.
Mr. Hacker:
: She might have been ahead, getting ready to put on the plane to get ___.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yes.
Thomas Swope:
That could be it.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, that was hairy. I have a -- Mary Cole __ Clark, she was in the Navy. No, she was on board a Navy ship. See, this part, this is this -- Ed kept saying I was in the South Pacific.
Mr. Hacker:
: Really the Central.
Ada Hacker:
Central Pacific and the Marshall Islands.
Thomas Swope:
It's all lumped together.
Mr. Hacker:
: There is where they almost crashed.
Ada Hacker:
Johnson, yeah.
Mr. Hacker:
: Johnson Island when she was on R&R.
Ada Hacker:
We were going back. You know, Johnson Island is a dot in the ocean. You see the thing as you're coming to it. And he almost went past it. He couldn't stop. Oh, that was scary. Yeah.
Thomas Swope:
That was coming back from R&R?
Ada Hacker:
Going.
Mr. Hacker:
: Going.
Ada Hacker:
And we had to worry about coming back on it. See, this was our nurse's quarters, basic, and then there is this one shot only of the operating. And that's our basic. I don't see any lights. And there's the __ Majura where I was holding one of those little babies. At Campbell, that's where we had so much of our actual hard training and all that business of being on our stomach and all that junk. You know it was interesting last year we went to, somebody from our church got in touch with me and said they were having this day honoring the Veterans, so they had it at Emerson Junior High School.
Thomas Swope:
Uh-huh.
Ada Hacker:
They had people -- got there for breakfast and they had people from all over. This one guy was a medical man, they said about medical. And I went up and I started talking to him. He said, I'm sorry, ma'am, I was in the Korean War, and I had an office job. So, you know, I wanted to talk to another person that had been, you know, involved in the war, in the training part or with taking care of people. And I couldn't find anybody. I thought sure I would see somebody. But there were a couple people from Korea I thought sure I would see, men. And there were only, no other nurses, right? Anyhow, they had us talk after the morning thing, we had coffee and talked to various people, they had us meet with the classes, 7th and 8th graders. And they were so fascinated. The teacher said to them, I have a nurse here that's going to tell us of her experiences. She is a veteran of World War II. They looked at me and said, gee, she is still alive and walking. It was really funny. This one time I was talking and I said something about 1942 and this kid, let's see, he says, you would be like, I said 80, I'll be 81 now. I'll be 82 in August. Eighty! They looked at each other. It was really a riot. So anyway, I started telling stuff. And they were fascinated. They didn't say a word. They didn't break in. They were so quiet. The teacher said afterwards, she said every eye was glued. I noticed they really took it in. And later on then they came up to the desk, and they were asking questions and stuff and looking at the pictures. It was fascinating. The one kid I said to him, what was it, are you going to be, go into the service or something? He said, I'm going to be a doctor, this one young boy that was interested. He said, I'm going to be a doctor. I said okay, you live long enough, you will probably get in the Army some day. He just kind of grinned. This one kid said, maybe you know my dad, or his grandfather. Turned out his grandfather. Of course I didn't know, but he was in WW 2, you know, in the Pacific somewhere.
Mr. Hacker:
: You could see where a kid could think that.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, sure. A lot of people want to know where I was. They had relatives, uncles and grandparents. Whatever. But the interest was great. The second one was the same way. They were just fascinated. She said they were studying about WW 2, and that it worked in with the Veterans Day. And it made me feel good actually. I was going to do it to do it. I said, what the heck. She said they were asking questions. You could tell they listened to every word that was said.
Thomas Swope:
Uh-huh.
Ada Hacker:
A lot of them had relatives. That's why they were so fascinated. Some were in the background, a parent or something.
Mr. Hacker:
: Remember one year on the elder hostel that couple there.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yes.
Mr. Hacker:
: Turned out they had a strange name.
Ada Hacker:
Slaughter.
Mr. Hacker:
: Slaughter was the pilot, wasn't he?
Ada Hacker:
One of them. S L A U G H T E R.
Mr. Hacker:
: And they wondered if -- and Jean thought she had dated him. And he was such a nice guy. He got killed. It was nice they could take the information back to his wife.
Ada Hacker:
His sister was there. I don't think it was her relative, but I told her what I knew of the man, who was a very nice guy. And it made her feel good. She said her brother, no, he wasn't killed. He came home. And she said he would never talk about it. And she said he was kind of bitter and forgetful. And she said he did marry and had a couple children, but he dialed suddenly. And she said we always felt so bad, she said, just at the prime of his life he left us. And then when he came back, he wasn't the same as when he left. She said, I'm going to go back and tell his wife and children that I met a nurse who knew him. I said fine, if it made her feel happy. You know, she said, the thing that got me, though, he was in Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands, and that's where I knew him. She had a picture of him. It wasn't like the one I remembered, but maybe I'm mixed up. I met a lot of different --
Thomas Swope:
Might not be the same guy.
Ada Hacker:
Exactly.
Mr. Hacker:
Ada Hacker:
The Warren Slaughter that I knew, I told her all about, and she just assumed, she just was convinced it was going to be it. So it made me feel good really. I thought, well. She always felt bad. She said he went away and he was such a great guy. And she said he was so changed when he came back, nobody knew him. And then he died early. And she said he wasn't the same person. A lot of them weren't the same people. A lot of them had it a lot worse than others. But too many of them, like out at the Veterans Hospital, too many, unfortunately, of the vets that are showing up are what they call mental cases, but they aren't mental. It's their minds that are bad, are shot. And some of them were actually in service and had bad experiences, and their bodies are all right but the mind is affected and will be forever. And others never actually went in the service -- they were in the service but never left the country, and they are claiming that they had all these problems, which they are just trying to get a lot of free stuff, according to this other guy, which is probably true. They said, I was in Vietnam, you know, the government owes me this. So, so be it. They had a lot of those. I mean, if that's the way they feel, so give them help. I mean, if they really feel it wrecked their lives. A lot of them say that it wrecked their lives. If they didn't even go out of the country, it still change their lives completely by making them give up whatever.
Mr. Hacker:
: We're not using the benefits that she could have.
Ada Hacker:
I feel guilty about using them.
Mr. Hacker:
Ada Hacker:
We signed up. We went just two years ago. I found out that they have this Rittman Hospital down in Rittman, Ohio, it's a new government, not -- a burial ground.
Mr. Hacker:
: Right.
Ada Hacker:
They had a program at the Rock River Senior Center, and this man talked and said anyone who is a vet is eligible to be buried there and their spouse. So, I found out about it. And they said absolutely I could be buried there. I said okay, why not. Our kids won't have to worry about it. Be cremated and be buried and he can be buried. They won't have to worry about where to put us. So then somebody said, well, you're a fool for not look into the other benefits like medication. You should get all that. You only pay $7 for a thing, and now it's 15 for the same medicine. So we back, and I had gone in twice. I said, Ed, I just, I want to keep my doctors. And they said I could go out there, but I said, oh, I felt guilty.
Mr. Hacker:
: We're not using it.
Ada Hacker:
I don't need it. Some other people need it. I just feel guilty.
Mr. Hacker:
: If I die maybe she would. But since I have to have something anyway.
Ada Hacker:
So I'm eligible, but there are a lot of people are really eligible that need it more than I do. It's that simple. The woman that first met me we was wonderful. Black woman nurse, you know.
Mr. Hacker:
: Doctor.
Ada Hacker:
Doctor, and she was so competent. She gave me the best physical I ever had in my life. She was just wonderful. She said, you can come out here and still keep your doctor. She said, no problem. You know, she kept pushing. So I don't know. You go out there and it's just mobbed.
Thomas Swope:
You're talking Rexel (ph)?
Mr. Hacker:
: Yeah.
Ada Hacker:
All these young people. You don't see any old ones. A couple old ones I saw, I thought they were WWII, but they are Korea. They are up in their 70s, Korea, they are not youngsters anymore.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Was he?
Thomas Swope:
He ended up, same thing, he was eligible for that stuff. So finally he did take advantage, but he ended up in a nursing home __+
Ada Hacker:
Well, that's supposed to be nice. Our woman doctor had transferred to that nursing home. And she would be a great one to be a doctor.
Thomas Swope:
Actually the people were really nice to him.
Ada Hacker:
That's what we hear.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
We have heard the same thing.
Thomas Swope:
Unfortunately, he was there at the time that they were remodeling. First he was in the nicer area, and then they were moved over, and they were remodeling or fixing up the nursing home. And he died actually in the nursing home unit there.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, but he was given good care you feel.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Good. That's great.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Was he?
Thomas Swope:
He had the effects of malnutrition when he was a prisoner of war.
Ada Hacker:
He was a prisoner? Oh, shoot.
Thomas Swope:
__+ I mean, he was fine all his life. It just caught up with him.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, that would be an effect, a long lasting thing that could show up later in his life.
Thomas Swope:
Caught up with him about 67 or so.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, yes, I can see that.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Oh, those men, prisoners in Europe or any of those, they had the hardest of any.
Thomas Swope:
Well, he had it, for Europe, he had it very tough. He was in a labor camp in 1945. So there wasn't food for anybody at that time.
Ada Hacker:
Oh, no, that would have been horrible.
Mr. Hacker:
: So malnutrition, forced labor.
Thomas Swope:
You know, you wouldn't know it if you had talked to him for the first 40 years.
Ada Hacker:
Thomas Swope:
He talked about it. He talked about it to me because he knew I was interested. But he was just, he had a great sense of humor. Really __.
Ada Hacker:
That was good. He kind of put it out of his mind for now to live every day as it was.
Thomas Swope:
In fact he did keep a diary.
Ada Hacker:
He did?
Thomas Swope:
Against the rules.
Ada Hacker:
I know.
Thomas Swope:
A little memo book.
Ada Hacker:
I know a lot of them did. I wish now I had put, had some kind of a thing, just for dates alone.
Thomas Swope:
Exactly. So, he had all of his dates up to the point he was captured.
Ada Hacker:
Okay.
Thomas Swope:
He kept his book hidden. He didn't write in it when he was a POW. He kept it hidden on his person and brought it home with him.
Ada Hacker:
That's great. That's really, that's great then.
Thomas Swope:
And then he did many, many years later, he finished up and wrote the prisoner of war experiences.
Ada Hacker:
Okay.
Thomas Swope:
He died about 25 years ago.
Ada Hacker:
Okay.
Thomas Swope:
Ada Hacker:
Well, see, that helps, I think. Especially the people who are prisoners. They said that really helps for them to get it out. A lot of them won't talk about it. After they do that, they feel better about everything in general. Finally getting it out of their mind and their system.
Thomas Swope:
He actually, he sat alone. He didn't want anybody with him. He sat alone in a cabin in PA and just recorded a tape of his experiences. And I have those tapes.
