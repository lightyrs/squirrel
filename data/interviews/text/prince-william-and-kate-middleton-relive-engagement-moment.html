Tom Bradby: People are obviously very curious about you, so let's start with the obvious. William, where did you propose, when, how. And Kate, what did you say?
</p>

<p>
Prince William: It was about three weeks ago on holiday in Kenya. We had a little private time away together with some friends and I just decided that it was the right time really. We had been talking about marriage for a while so it wasn't a massively big surprise. I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya and I proposed.
</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/princess-waiting-kate-middleton-12159610">Miss Kate Middleton</a>: It was very romantic (laughs). There's a true romantic in there.
</p>

<p>
TB: So you said yes, obviously?
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton: Of course, yes.
</p>

<p>
William: Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
TB: And you knew you were going to do this from day one of the holiday or you waited until the end?
</p>

<p>
William: I'd been planning it for a while but as every guy out there will know it
takes a certain amount of motivation to get yourself going. So I was planning it
and then it just felt really right out in Africa. It was beautiful at the time.
I just â¦ I had done a little bit of planning to show my romantic side.
</p>

<p>
TB: Kate, you'd been on holiday a while so did you see this coming, was he getting a bit nervous and jumpy?
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton: No, not at all because we were out with friends and things so I really didn't expect it all. I thought he might have maybe thought about it, but no. It was a total shock when it came, and very excited.
</p>

<p>
TB: And produced a ring there and then?
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton: Yes.
</p>

<p>
TB: there and then?
</p>

<p>
William: I did, yes. I had been carrying it around with me in my rucksack for about three weeks before that and I literally would not let it go, everywhere I went I was keeping hold of it because I knew this thing, if it disappeared I
would be in a lot of trouble and because I'd planned it, it went fine. You hear a lot of horror stories about proposing and things going horribly wrong - it went really, really well and I was really pleased she said yes.
</p>

<p>
TB: And it's a family ring?
</p>

<p>
William: It is a family ring, yes. It's my mother's engagement ring. So I
thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to
share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her
sort of close to it all.
</p>

<p>
TB: I guess we better have a look at it. What kind of ring is it, are you an
expert on what's â¦?
</p>

<p>
William: I'm not an expert on it at all. I've been reliably informed it's a sapphire with
some diamonds. I'm sure everyone recognizes it from previous times.
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton: It's beautiful.
</p>

<p>
TB: Kate, you're going to be the envy of many.
</p>

<p>
Miss Middleton: Well, I just hope I look after it. It's very, very special.
</p>

<p>
William: If she loses it she's in big trouble.
</p>

<p>
TB: Now it has to be said, you both look incredibly happy and relaxed.
</p>

<p>
William: We are. We are. We're like sort of ducks, very calm on the surface with little feet going under the water. But uh no, it's been really exciting because we've been talking about it for a long time so for us, it's a real relief and it's really nice to
be able to tell everybody. Especially for the last two or three weeks it's been quite difficult not
telling anyone, and keeping it to ourselves for reasons we had to. And it's really nice to finally be able to share it with everyone.
</p>

<p>
TB: : And you obviously have kept it a secret. So when did you ask Kate's dad and what did he
say and what did your respective parents say when you told them?
