ON WALL STREET, NO ONE HAS EARNED A BIGGER REPUTATION FOR CUTTING COMPANIES DOWN TO SIZE THAN CORPORATE TURNAROUND ARTIST ALBERT J. DUNLAP. THE WEST POINT GRADUATE PARACHUTES INTO TROUBLED COMPANIES, CUTS THEM TO THE CORE AND JUMP-STARTS THEIR STOCK.
AS HEAD OF SCOTT PAPER AND, MORE RECENTLY, AS CEO OF SUNBEAM, DUNLAP HAS CARRIED OUT HIS TIME-TESTED FORMULA. HIS STRATEGY, SPELLED OUT IN HIS BLUNTLY-TITLED BOOK, MEAN BUSINESS, IS TO BOOST THE BOTTOM LINE WITH SWIFT, DEEP LAYOFFS; SELL OFF DIVISIONS, MOVE PRODUCTION TO LOWER-WAGE STATES OR, BETTER YET, ABROAD.
FOR DUNLAP, THERE IS NO GREATER MEASURE OF SUCCESS THAN WATCHING HIS COMPANYï¿½S STOCK PRICE SOAR. I SAT DOWN WITH HIM AT HIS SUNBEAM OFFICE IN DELRAY, FLORIDA, TO TALK ABOUT HIS MANAGEMENT PHILOSOPHY.
SMITH: In your book Mean Business, youï¿½re -- youï¿½re very critical of consensus leadership. Why?
 DUNLAP: I think because in consensus youï¿½re mitigating to less than the best decision. Everyone has something to say. I think what you have to do, you have to listen to what everyone has to say, but then youï¿½ve got to make a decision, and thatï¿½s called leadership. Someone has to stand up and be accountable for the final decision.
SMITH: You mean one guy has to be in command? Weï¿½re back to West Point?
DUNLAP: Weï¿½re back to what I -- what I would call good business practices. Someone has to take responsibility. Someone has to be willing to make the decision. And a lot of people donï¿½t want to do that. Theyï¿½ll say, ï¿½Well, this is the decision and we all made it.ï¿½ Therefore, no oneï¿½s accountable. No one can be wrong.
SMITH: And at Scott you said, when you came in, things were too congenial.
DUNLAP: Thatï¿½s right. Here Scott had just lost two hundred seventy-seven million dollars. They were on credit watch. Marketing share was falling precipitously, and it was a very congenial -- uh -- type environment.
SMITH: I think you said one of the first things you did was to fire the morale officer. You said, ï¿½To hell with harmonyï¿½?
DUNLAP: Well, it was the most amazing thing. I went to an operating committee meeting, and there was nothing, of course, but bad news. And there was one person sitting there. And I said, ï¿½What does that person do?ï¿½ And they said, ï¿½Well, thatï¿½s the morale officer.ï¿½ I said, ï¿½Well, what does a morale officer do?ï¿½ ï¿½Well, thatï¿½s to be sure that everyone is getting along.ï¿½ I said, ï¿½Thatï¿½s the last thing we need. We need everyone to be jumping up and down saying, ï¿½Letï¿½s fix this corporation, and letï¿½s do the right thing.ï¿½ï¿½
SMITH: Now, I have to say, reading your book -- uh -- I couldnï¿½t help but feel that -- that part of you was sort of deliberately cultivating the tough guy image. I mean you said at one point, ï¿½I am a tough guy. I like tough guys.ï¿½ At one point you said, ï¿½For Sir James, I was a sledgehammer.ï¿½ -- uh -- you know, you do the Rambo -- uh -- stuff. Youï¿½ve got the ï¿½Rambo in Pinstripes.ï¿½ Itï¿½s the headline of another chapter. I mean why -- is that part of it? I mean, if people know in advance when youï¿½re coming, youï¿½re a tough guy -- I mean is that part of your success story? Is that part of your strategy to cultivate the tough guy image?
DUNLAP: Well, I think they know Iï¿½m a no-nonsense person. Iï¿½m not coming there to listen to all the excuses which theyï¿½ve been giving. Thatï¿½s what got them into trouble to begin with. Iï¿½m not there to hear what canï¿½t be done. Iï¿½m there to get results. Iï¿½m there to challenge people beyond what theyï¿½ve ever been challenged before. And so, if thatï¿½s tough, then yes, I am tough.
SMITH: But itï¿½s also imagery. I mean, you are tough, but -- but -- but -- um -- a lot of people are tough, but theyï¿½re quiet about it. Youï¿½re tough, but youï¿½re out front about it.
DUNLAP: Well, you know, Iï¿½m out front on just about everything. I have strong views on most things. Iï¿½m a very passionate person, a person of deep ideology, and Iï¿½m normally willing to express my views on things.
SMITH: But thereï¿½s an advantage. I mean when -- whe-- I mean -- we watch Wall Street. And you walk into a company and the stock price goes up. Why? I mean, part of itï¿½s track record, but part of it, people know Al Dunlapï¿½s the tough guy.
 DUNLAP: Well, I think...
SMITH: Isnï¿½t there a payoff?
DUNLAP: Well, I think that, when you looked at when I came to Sunbeam, the stock went up fifty-nine percent the first day, and thatï¿½s, weï¿½re led to believe, the highest, biggest increase in the stock price of a New York Stock Exchange traded company in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. But I think, why is that happening? Thatï¿½s happening because people know what Iï¿½m gonna do. They know Iï¿½m gonna put together the best management team. They know Iï¿½m gonna dramatically cut the cost. They know Iï¿½m gonna focus on the core business. And they know Iï¿½m gonna come up with a winning strategy, and thatï¿½s really what theyï¿½re betting on. And they know Iï¿½ll implement it.
SMITH: And you make accessibility -- uh -- to you for the Wall Street analysts an absolutely critical element of your leadership. Isnï¿½t that right?
DUNLAP: Oh, itï¿½s -- itï¿½s an element of my leadership. I believe that the shareholders own the company. They take all the risks. No one ever gives them their money back. And theyï¿½re the people I work for. And the shareholders are the moms and pops of America. So I have an obligation to be accessible when somebody asks me, ï¿½What are you doing? How are you gonna achieve results?ï¿½ I have to tell them what Iï¿½m going to do and how Iï¿½m gonna do it ï¿½cause they own the company.
 SMITH: You told me you didnï¿½t have any other common stock other than Kimberly Clark. I find that interesting. Do you have faith in the other corporate leaders?
DUNLAP: Well, I -- I own substantial amounts of Sunbeam stock. I have a small amount ofÂ  -- of Kimberlyï¿½s stock. And then the rest of my investments are basically in treasuries and -- uh -- insured bonds, things of that nature because I think an executive should invest very heavily in his own company, and he should be focused like a laser on running that company. If he sees other companies as a better investment, that tells something about what he thinks about his own company.
SMITH: Sir James Goldsmith said at one point -- uh -- uh -- that he liked having you around not only because you were tough and you were good and you bored in, but you were, as Sir James said, a barking dog. You made a lot of noise, and Wall Street paid a lot of attention. 
DUNLAP: Well, you know, Sir James obviously is -- everyone has their heroes. Sir James is a great hero to me. Sir James really enhanced my business career. He opened up a whole global environment. Heï¿½s an -- heï¿½s an outstanding financier, and I have enormous respect for Jimmy. And I believe Jimmy -- uh -- believed that, if youï¿½re running a business, you should do it with every fabric and fiber of your body. And I did that, and I think he was impressed by that. 
SMITH: And he liked the barking dog part. 
DUNLAP: Sure. Sir James is -- i-- i-- is not a shy person. And I donï¿½t think he wants to be surrounded by people who will not stand up for things. 
SMITH: Youï¿½re not a shy person either. 
DUNLAP: No. And one of the things I learned from Sir James -- he took an -- he took a position on most issues of his day, and many times he was criticized, but I never saw him back off. 
SMITH: mmhmm -- um -- in your book, again, I -- I was struck by your conversations and -- and -- and writing about Cary Packer. At one point you said about Cary Packer, ï¿½weï¿½re two strong-willed, dominant animals who like to hunt the prey.ï¿½ I look around your office. I mean there are eagles. There are lions -- strong-willed dominant animals. I mean they fascinate you.
DUNLAP: Well, I think they do, and I think part of it has to do with -- you look at various animals. They have to go out and get their own meal. They survive by their own wits. No oneï¿½s going out and getting room service for them. No oneï¿½s making their life easy. They have to stand on their own wits, on their own cunning, on their own intellect, on their own instincts, and I think thereï¿½s something to be respected in that. 
SMITH: The animals youï¿½ve picked, though, are not ones that one would think would have to order room service. I mean lions, the -- the king beast, dragons at your pool, eagles. I mean these are -- these are the most powerful predators in nature. 
DUNLAP: Well, many of these animals also have dual symbolism to me. Iï¿½m a Leo, born in July, so thatï¿½s the lions. I tend to be very nationalistic and very patriotic, and the eagle plays to that. And I -- as I say, I do appreciate animals that are strong and protect themselves and can provide for themselves... 
 SMITH: -- um -- and who are tough and who are winners. 
DUNLAP: Thatï¿½s right. There -- you know, I never apologize for being tough. I never apologize for winning. I didnï¿½t apologize when I was poor, and Iï¿½m certainly not gonna apologize when Iï¿½m successful. 
DUNLAP: You know, the interesting thing about most of the nicknames -- itï¿½s really quite humorous when you think about it -- ï¿½Rambo in Pinstripesï¿½ was given to me by Sir James Goldsmith. Sir James said, ï¿½You know, youï¿½re like Rambo. You go into the most archaic situations. And, when the smoke clears, youï¿½ve won the battle and saved the company.ï¿½ -- meant to be a compliment. -- uh -- the -- uh -- ï¿½Chainsawï¿½ was given to me by John Aspen, the famous British naturalist. He said, ï¿½You know, youï¿½re like a chainsaw. You cut away all the fat and leave a great sculpture -- again, meant to be a compliment by somebody I respect. But, you know, the media is in the business of -- of -- of selling print or selling time, and those original nicknames which are meant as compliments get taken a bit out of context. And, of course, you resent it when it gets taken out of context. 
SMITH: But thereï¿½s a part of you, Al, I mean -- you know, even today, thereï¿½s a part -- you like the confrontation. You like the competition. You like the battle. Thatï¿½s part of what gets your juices flowing. Isnï¿½t that right? 
DUNLAP: Well, Iï¿½m a very competitive person. I like to take on the situations that no one else will take on. You know, when I went to Scott, theyï¿½d interviewed a person before me. I was just coming back from Australia. And he told the board three things. He said, ï¿½Number one, Iï¿½m not taking the job. Number two, anyone who takes the job is a fool. And number three, by the way, youï¿½re going bust.ï¿½ And then they called on me. So Iï¿½ve gone into the most difficult of -- of situations, and Iï¿½ve also stood up to the most difficult issues of our time.
SMITH: But most people would not like to walk into a board room unaccompanied and look at an eleven-member executive committee and say, ï¿½You two Iï¿½m keeping. The rest of you are fired. Goodbye.ï¿½ That is not typical behavior from leaders. What is it? I mean, why do you like to do that? What -- what is it that -- that -- that turns you on and -- and -- and that makes it work for you? 
DUNLAP: I donï¿½t know that youï¿½d say, ï¿½You like to do that.ï¿½ But, when you go into a company thatï¿½s failing miserably, it all starts at the top. And, when you go in, you know these are the people that created the problem, so youï¿½re gonna have very little empathy for those people. Theyï¿½re the people that have created the problem for the workers in the factory, and so you get rid of those people. As long as theyï¿½re there, youï¿½re not gonna be able to improve the company. Now, most people donï¿½t do that because the minute you do that you create controversy.
