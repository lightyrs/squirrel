<p>Lynn Hershman: How did the Guerrilla Girls start? </p>

<p><b>"Kathe Kollwitz"</b>: You know the Guerrilla Girls began in 1985. In 1984 the Museum of Modern Art opened another new building, another renovation with an exhibit called "An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture," and in this exhibit there were 169 artists and virtually all of them were male and almost none of them were artists of color. I think there were thirteen women artists in the show. That was it. So women artists in New York were pretty in sensed about this and I think it was the women's caucus for art which had a, they called a demonstration against, sorry I need a minute. Okay I am going to start again.
</p>

<p>In 1984 the Museum of Modern Art opened an exhibit called "An International Survey of Painting and Sculpture," and in this exhibition there were one-hundred-sixty-nine artists, very few were women or people of color. I think the number of women was thirteen or seventeen. It was pretty pathetic. So the women's caucus for art I think it was called a demonstration in front of the museum and I remember Frida Kahlo and I, the Guerrilla girl Frida Kahlo, and I Kathe Kollwitz, went to this demonstration. So we are walking around on a picket line and nobody paid attention to it. We were kind of shocked. I mean women artists in New York were so upset about it but the public didn't care at all. In fact it was pretty clear that they thought that whatever was in the museum was the stuff that was supposed to be in the museum and whatever wasn't was the stuff that wasn't supposed to be in it. And I remember us walking and walking and walking and at one point we just turned to each other and we said, there had got to be a better way. There has got to be a way to do something that came break through people's notions about this issue and maybe change people's minds and that was the idea for having a group. It then took a bunch of months before we actually called a meeting in Frida's loft and a bunch of people there started the Guerrilla Girls. </p>

<p>: Why gorillas? Why masks?
</p>

<p>: Well those are, gorillas and masks, are two pretty different things. Okay, First of all, we wanted an outrageous name that really signified the difference between us and the generation of feminists who came before us. So that was one reason we wanted to use the word girls. At that time you were never allowed to call anyone female a girl because there had been a big fight just to call them women and I remember we had in our early group a couple of women from that first generation of feminists artists. We had to convince them that it was okay to do this girl thing. And of course Guerrilla, it was alliterative. It just was one of those things that just came up. We had the idea to do posters before we even had a group. So we spent that first meeting doing the research for the first couple of posters and almost immediately after that, I think it was may of 1985 we snuck around in the middle of the night in New York and put those first two posters up in the street and then all hell broke loose. So one thing that happened was people wanted to talk to us. Who were these Guerrilla Girls? What's going on, you know? And we had decided to be anonymous. </p>

<p>I have to be honest about this. We decided to be anonymous for purely self-serving reasons. The art world was a small place and we didn't want to screw up our careers so it seemed a lot better to not say who you were, we would just put these mysterious things up on the street. But really quickly we figured out that this anonymity was an absolute, great thing. The reason was that it kept the focus on the issues, not on our personalities. And because the art world is this clubby, bitchy, nasty sort of place no one could look at our work and say, "Oh I know who is doing that, I hate her art. Why should I pay attention to what she is saying in these political posters?" </p>

<p>But once we decided to be anonymous and people wanted to talk to us, we needed some kind of disguise and if you look at the early pictures in the group, people are wearing ski masks, people are wearing bags over their heads and we are not sure exactly how the gorilla masks started but our, a cocraful story, for what its worth at this time, was one of our early members was kind of doodling during a meeting and she was writing the word Gorilla, the animal instead of Guerrilla the freedom fighter, and it was at the same moment that we were trying to figure out some kind of disguise and it was like the heavens parted and there was out what we would like to call our "masculinity." </p>

<p>: Do you think the strategies have changed now? </p>

<p>: Well that's a tough question. In one way. What's interesting is that in a lot of ways our strategy has not changed at all. We had this idea to do a kind of political art that didn't just point and something and complain and say, this is wrong. We had an idea to twist issues around and use facts and humor, do something, put something out there that could hopefully break through peoples pre-conceived notions and maybe, maybe, maybe just once in a while change peoples minds about the issues. That is what we are still doing today. We are doing it in slightly different ways because over time, well first of all, we almost immediately branched out from the art world. We kind of spun our idea out in every way in the art word, which we are still doing that as well. We also branched out into other areas of politics and culture, which we are still doing that as well and after a few years we also had some other issues. Well in a poster, if you really think about it you can only do one quick think. You have a headline. You have an image. It's got to be pretty quick. I mean we try to pack a punch into our so it really makes you think about things in a different way and you can really take off with it and think about the issue differently. But, we also found over time we wanted to get deeper into certain issues and that led us to write books. We wrote a book on art history, a book on stereotypes, our most recent book about art museums. </p>

<p>We also wanted to, we also got so many letters from people all over the world about different issues and people would contact us like a group of directors in Hollywood and that led us to do a whole huge Hollywood campaign which we are still doing also. So we started doing a little collaboration, we started writing books um, so its changed physically in that way and of course people have changed over the years and brought in different ideas over the years but basically our strategy oddly enough is the same.
</p>

<p>: And what did you do in Venice?
</p>

<p>: A very strange thing has happened in the last couple of years and we are confused and conflicted about it and that is the art world at least in Europe not much in the United States thank goodness, has suddenly embraced us and we have been asked to be in a bunch of international exhibitions and sometimes do work for those exhibitions and the Venice Biennale in 2005 is a perfect example of that. It was the first year ever in its 110 year history that the Biennale had women directors and women curators, these directors, each curated one of the major group shows in the Biennale and Rosa Martinez who was one of the directors and the curator of the exhibition called, she titled it, "Always a little further," asked us if we would do a large scale installation. So we thought about it for a while and it's always a dilemma. This group was founded by outsiders, we have women in our group who are very successful artists. We have always had a range, you know a range in every way. </p>

<p>But in terms of our career, so we have had women who have been successful, we have had women who have never shown their work anywhere. But even the ones who have been successful, we have always felt like outsiders. And it's our preferred stance, I mean I don't think we would have come up with this work without this feeling. So to suddenly be insiders is complicated. Also we question whether they are using us and I think the answer is yea, but I guess we are using them to. So we thought about it a lot and we decided we feel it's so important for our voice to be out there where there isn't a voice like this. It can only be a good thing to walk into a major international exhibition and see it all framed. I mean basically our first huge banner, like 20 foot high thing that we did was about the Biennale itself and we researched all the years of the Biennale and it said, (Welcome to the feminist Biennale, said in Italian). Excuse my Italian accent, you know "Welcome to the feminist Biennale." And then it had all these ironic pieces of information and statistics. We always back up what we are saying with facts. So we had all these statistics about the paltry number of women in the Biennale over, overall the years. And it has been really paltry. </p>

<p>So when you walked into the Biennale, we are right in the beginning. It kind of framed that exhibit through that sort of filter, about art in Venice. We did another poster where we took the famous movie poster from Le Dolce Vita which shows Marcello Mastroianni riding on Anita Ekberg. She is on hands and knees and he is riding on top of her and we put a bunch of statistics about the museums of Venice on that poster with the headline, "Where are the women artists of Venice?" underneath the men because we found out, in every museum in Venice they have women in their collection but they have women in their collection but they are in the basement, they are in storage. You know, somehow they never get to see the light of day up with all the tourists up there. So you looked at it. You looked at this whole exhibition through those two introductory posters about Venice itself and then a selection of some of other works. Some of our movie billboards and other things like that. </p>

<p>: Did what your action in New York, your purpose, did that have an effect on the Museum of Modern Art, did they answer what you were stating at all?
</p>

<p>: [Laughter.] Well no. First of all the curator of that exhibition, Kinston McShine, as if it wasn't bad enough that the numbers were so bad, he went around town saying, "Any artist who is not in this exhibition should rethink his career." Well we were all in this world of artists in New York City, and we knew all of us that there were tones of great women artists. There was no question about it but it was very clear that it was almost impossible after some gains of the wave of feminism in the late sixties and seventies, there had been incredible backlash and things were worse then they had been in years for women artists, the Museum Of Modern Art, of course not. You know everyone gets defensive. </p>

<p>We fingered one group after another. We went after artists themselves, we said why should artists, successful male artists, they have to speak up about this. So we went after them, we went after critics. we went after curators. We went after the museums in general. We went after one group after another and slowly I think things did start to change because our figures were undeniable. We had letters from our critics saying, I never realized that my coverage was so poor, that I almost never wrote about women. We had people write to us and say, I notice that my boss, the head of some gallery or something was mentioned in one of your recent posters, you're right he is an asshole. Here is fifty dollars. You know, stuff like that would happen as well. We also, you know you have got to forgive me because now I have been thinking so intensely and our group has thought so intensely about these issues for so many years, we now really feel that some discrimination is conscious but a lot of unconscious. I mean these weren't all evil horrible people. They were just upholding the status quo. It was a boy's world. There was a stereotype of the male, macho artist, flinging paint around, drinking bottles of bourbon with three cute babes over there in the side of the room, you know splashing paint all over the place. I mean that's what we were up against. You know women don't quite fit into that stereotype and its still after all of these years, things are so much better now, at least at the entry level. There is still believe it or not there is a long way to go. </p>

<p>: And so how did that power structure happen to start? </p>

<p>: Well, first of all we are talking about thousands of years of misogyny. Lee Krasner's name was Lenore. Here is a women who was married to one of the most successful painters of her day, Jackson Pollock and she felt embarrassed that she was a women, so embarrassed that she thought she would have a better chance if she changed her name to something that didn't sound female so it's a long haul. You don't change these attitudes over night. It's more like one step forward, two steps back, another step forward. One little thing at a time. </p>

<p>: Is there anything particular that always gets left out of the books? Always left out of history when talking about art movements? </p>

<p>: Well first of all feminist scholarship has changed the world not just in art, it's changed it every field. History is being written about differently. Literature is being talked about differently and certainly art now is put in context of its time and that's incredibly important because when you see what life was like for female and male artists at different times in history you can see what the, what the, that women weren't allowed to participate in the same way. And once you see that you understand why the canon became the canon. We do think however that there is a basic problem in art in which there is this construct in that one genius begets the next, begets the next, begets the next. It's very interesting. Woman artists are almost never talked about in terms of male art. They are only compared to other women artists. Why? It doesn't make any sense. </p>

<p>When they write about someone's work it's always in connection with other women artists when women are a part of there own time and are in a world with lots of different kinds of world artists. So that doesn't make any sense, that's still a kind of prejudice I think. And it's the same with artists of color. They are usually compared with artists of the same race who came before them and that can be a little bit wrong when it comes to different artists but somehow the art world isn't there yet. We also think that, that because the art world is set up to make it the story of the few, it's like the Olympics. There are winners and there are losers and when you really look back at history that's not exactly what its like. There are always a number of really interesting artists. If you look around you know there are so many great artists of all sorts but they are kind of compressed over time to five or ten from each generation and we totally believe that the art world could only benefit from being more inclusive and kind of just fire that canon. Throw that canon out the window. It may be hard to throw a canon out the window but try it. It's time to do it. </p>

<p>: What did you do at the Tate?
</p>

<p>: At the Tate, we were just brought in to do two appearances. So we did this workshop with the curators at the Tate and some outside agitators, like a conference about how you hang a museum collection, you know what's included, what's not included. And then we just did, you know the Guerrilla Girls have from the very beginning and in all our incarnations you know gone around the country and around the world giving talks about what we do, you know our philosophy about political art. And also meeting people, hearing their issues, working with them on issues like that. So we also did that at the Tate. I have to say that was a total gas. First of all we had a huge group of people and they were really enthusiastic and interesting and the Tate Modern itself is like such a zoo that, that alone was a really interesting experience. But the reason we were invited to do that was that the Tate in re-hanging their collection which they did a couple of months ago, they had bought from somewhere, not from us, a group of Guerrilla Girl posters, not from us and they put them all in a room. So its all our early posters like the first five years all in a room at the Tate Museum. So after our talk we took the audience up there and also an overflow crowd who couldn't get in and that was really a gas. we were just hanging out and talking. That was really fun. </p>

<p>: Can you say anything about the West Coast Guerrilla Girls? </p>

<p>: There are no west coast Guerrilla Girls. There is one Guerrilla Girls, and there are two other groups: Guerrilla Girls on Tour and Guerrilla Girls Broadband. Between the groups? Yea. Time passes and all sorts of things happen and at a certain point we decided to split into three. So, two of the founders of the Guerrilla Girls and also other members, that's Frida Kahlo and me, Kathe Kollwitz and other members formed, you know we are the Guerrilla Girls and then Guerrilla Girls Broadband was started by one of the founding members and a bunch of other women and then Guerrilla Girls on Tour was started by a few members who had joined in the late nineties to do work about theatre. They were women from the theatre work, and they are doing more stuff about theatre and the theatrical kind of performances. I mean it's about the world of theatre, not art or other things.
</p>

<p>: Do you think it will continue?
</p>

<p>: Well, first of all until all those bad people out there stop behaving the way they are behaving there is so much work to do. You know, there is no lack of work to do. Oh, god. Should it have continued this long? Some people would say, no we don't think so, you know but for us its about the work. We have always found incredibly fascinating, interesting things to do as our next projects. We are totally engaged with that. We wished that we had done so much more. </p>

<p>There is so much we haven't even touched on. One of the things we want to do now is a whole thing about globalism. We still want to try to rehabilitate the F word, feminism, that so many women don't want to call themselves feminists and then if you talk to them about it, its clear that they support all of the tenants of feminism. You know equal pay for equal work, equal opportunity, you know right down the board but they don't want to be called feminists, why? Because the media has demonized feminists as they whiney, complaining, humorless, ugly, and okay yes many of us are whiny, complaining, humorous, humorless are ugly but some of us are humorous and ugly, you know give us a break here. There have always been so many different kinds of feminism. Every generation invents it's own. We go, the young women we see all over the county, so many of them are committed, feminists and activists. It's the ones who aren't, you know who write the books complaining about feminism, you know the backlash people who get all the attention.
</p>

<p>: What are the things that you think the feminist movement changed in the arts? </p>

<p>: Well I think feminism is a way of looking at the world, and I think its changed everything. Its changed scholarship particularly in things like history where now historians, some historians anyway are not just thinking about the leaders, the generals. You know they are writing about the people, they are trying to do new research about all eras of history in terms of what people lives were like. That's a huge change. Feminism has also changed, been hugely influential on artists themselves and I think its inspired a lot of women to become artists who might not have otherwise and fighting for our rights in the art world, if we go back there for just a second, has resulted in more women, more women's work being out there and being shown and appreciated and that's a great thing. You want to have all the voices of our culture represented. God a hundred years from now, what if museums collected all the wrong stuff? You know there you are, you are in, what is a hundred years from now? Twenty-one-o-six. You go to the museums and there is no work by women, you know there is no work by women of color, there is no work by white women, there is no work there. That's not a picture of our culture. That's not what's going on right now. So it's even more our responsibility for the future, to try to make sure that people change their discriminating ways. </p>

<p>: What do you think are the most pressing issues right now? </p>

<p>: Um, I think the global issues are the most pressing issues, and we have done some work with Amnesty International recently and we want to do a lot more about women's rights globally. We were just in Istanbul where there are enclaves of women who have a lot of freedom, women artists there in Istanbul itself have an incredible amount of freedom and their work is actually appreciated. Statistically they are doing better than their counterparts in the United States. However, in Turkey there is still so much oppression against women that many of the artists are doing work about that. For instance the whole honor suicide phenomenon, this is yet another really disgusting way that men figure out how to oppress women. </p>

<p>If you are a young girl and you even look at some guy, you have dishonored your family. If you go even further than that you have ruined your family. So your brothers and your father used to murder you, you know no law. They just go after you and they kill you. Well, because the government is getting more progressive, they are now cracking down on those what they call honor killings. So now the men in turkey have figured out a way around this, they have convinced the girl to commit suicide, including sometimes locking her in a room with all of these messages saying, this is the only way your family will ever gets its honor back you know all kinds of psychological pressures and unfortunately in many cases that's working.
</p>

<p>I think the main issue is for some reason women have been denied rights in almost every society.
</p>

<p>Women have been denied even the most basic rights in almost every society that we know about through history. It's only been in the last maybe hundred years in certain countries in the west that women have had any rights. You know right to own property, right to divorce, right not to obey their husbands or their fathers or their brothers or whatever male was put in charge of them and in most of the world this is still the case so I think its going to take a long time but there is no question that the struggle toward basic human rights for all people is probably the most pressing issue facing activists. Obviously you can't solve it but can you do one little thing after another. You know that's always been our policy. Don't worry, about the big thing, you know we put two posters up on the street twenty years ago and look what happened. Just do one little thing and see what happens. </p>

<p>: Do you receive different reactions when you are doing more global action outside of the United States how do people respond to you? </p>

<p>: I think it's always all over the map. We have already gotten a bunch of letters from people who walked into the Tate and were so happy to see something different there, you know something with a different kind of message and it really meant something to them. You know our influence is still minuscule and the more I can tell you about the people who correspond with us, you know we get a lot of hate male, we get a lot of love letters and everything in between and that's how it should be. You know we wouldn't be happy, in a way it bothers us that we are so loved and accepted now. You know, cut that out. </p>

<p>: What do you think, what were your most effective campaigns throughout the history of the Guerrilla Girls? </p>

<p>: Okay, well doing one little thing at a time, it might be hard to talk about what's been most effective. But I think over time we did really make a difference in the art world, not just us but other groups to. We made it okay to count. We made it okay to talk about the issues and once you start talking about the issues of feminism and the number of women's artists and artists of color people change and do better. You can't not because you see how pathetically bad it is. In other areas in think we have had a big effect on some people who read our message. There is this false media culture and then there is the real culture who is out there and obviously we connect with people all over the world. We get letters from all over the world. We get letters from Brazil, Tanzania, Salt Lake City, everywhere you can imagine from people of all ages men and women but also a significant number of young girls who have no one to turn to who have issues in their lives that they are stuck in, they cant really cope with. We think its great to be a model for anyone that accepts us as a model for a kind of insane activism, like do it your way, if you want to write a letter, write a letter, if you want to go to a picket line go to a picket line, but you can also invent some crazy identity and put on some kind of mask and do weirdo art and change the world that way.
</p>

<p>: Was the idea of identity, can you speak about why you made this other identity?
</p>

<p>: Oh, could you explain that a little more?</p>

<p>But what was the question?
</p>

<p>: Well, why was so much of the feminist work of the seventies and eighties was about identity? About creating this other identity, just to say why it was necessary to create identities? </p>

<p>: Well, first of all, we are tormented artists so we do everything differently. There is certainly a lot of stuff we could have done better. Sometimes you just look at some of the, even some of the posters and think oh I wish we could rewrite that one today. So we certainly could have been more comprehensive and done much better that way but you know you are kind of stuck with you work and we just muddled along and did things about one issue after another and tried to do it best. </p>

<p>: What advice would you give young artists and emerging artists today? </p>

<p>: When I give advice to young artists this is what I say, first of all the world of artists is fantastic, it's a great life. You know you are thinking, you are in touch with so many ideas and stuff to fool around with, your camera or whatever but lets face it, the art world sucks. It's a horrible system, if you choose to be part of that system and you certainly deserve to succeed in that system if you choose and we totally support you, we want you to succeed, you have to be aware of that. And that means that you always have to think how the system could be better, how the system could be changed. In other words we say be an artist great, but also even in your own little way you know in whatever way you can in all the hours you have leftover after you know doing your work be an activist to. Don't forget to stand up for what you believe in because that does slowly make a difference. </p>

<p>: And the whole glass ceiling thing, internalizing the cultural projections of their limits, can you say anything about how you think that we can take steps to change that?
</p>

<p>: Well in terms of the glass ceiling, society has to be changed. You know there has to be an accommodation for women's lives particularly women that choose to raise or bear children. This is something that is definitely time consuming and women can't be discounted because they choose to do something like that. So that's number one. Maybe women's careers have different trajectories than men's careers. This is something that law firms and hospitals are wresting with right now. It's something that the art world should be aware of to. The glass ceiling, it's a steel ceiling still in so many fields, you know women get to a certain point and not quite further and the only way they are going to get further is for the people right above them to change and make sure to go out of their way to take a chance on women. This is what directors tell us all the time. You can have the hot film at Sundance that took you ten years of scrounging with your credit card, blah, blah, blah, to make. And if you are female its still really hard to get a deal for a movie. If you are a guy everyone is falling all over you. Now that doesn't mean the guys movie will be successful or not but its just not a level playing field, its so much harder for women. So we say to the people in power, some of who are women now, do your part.
