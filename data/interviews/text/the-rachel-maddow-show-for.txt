 RACHEL MADDOW, HOST:Â  Ladies and gentlemen, the Jon Stewart interviewâin which Mr. Stewart gives a lengthy and is in my view mostly but entirely fair critique of cable news as improbably elevating partisan distinctions between us as Americans.
 In which Mr. Stewart describes what he sees as different rules for what he does as a satirist and for what we on cable news doâand I frankly don't buy it, not at all, not even for a minute.
 In which Mr. Stewart gives a defense of George W. Bush on the Iraq war and waterboardingâa defense which I don't really agree with but I think was interesting to hear.
 In which Jon StewartâJon Stewart does not throw up, despite having a really acute, horrible stomach thing, the poor guy.
 The Jon Stewart interview is right here.
 MADDOW:Â  Jon Stewart, thank you for coming in.Â  I know you're under the weather.Â  It's nice of you to come in.
 JON STEWART, HOST, "THE DAILY SHOW":Â  I have the baboons, but I'm happy to be here.Â  I'm here to take the medicine.
 MADDOW:Â  You are here as the 24-hour-political-pundit-perpetual-panic-conflictanator.
 STEWART:Â  Conflictanator, by the way, is reference to "Phineas and Ferb," the cartoon.
 MADDOW:Â  Oh!
 STEWART:Â  The evil Doofenshmirtz, Dr. Doofenshmirtz.Â  My kids are watching it.Â  He makes is an anator.Â  Conflictanator.
 I think I've read every one that you've done in the last couple of years because I tend to over-prepare.
 STEWART:Â  After the rally itâyou know, whenever you go out there, whatever you put out, you can only control your intention.Â  You can't control its perception or how people receive it.Â  And you can control your execution.
 So, when people are perceiving it as somethingâpeople that I respect are perceiving as something that we didn't perceive it as sort of either two or three things, one is we were inartful in the way that we conceived it and presented it, our intention was wrong or off, not clear.Â  Or it's being misperceived.Â  So, I guessâthere's probably four.Â  I don't know what that would be.
 MADDOW:Â  On the issue of the perception of the rally in media, Bill Maher said Bill Maher's criticism of it was this.Â  He said, "When Jon announced his rally, he said that the national conversation is dominated by people on the right who believe Obama is a socialist and people on the left who believe 9/11 was an inside job.Â  But I can't name any Democrat leaders who think 9/11 was an inside job."
 STEWART:Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  "Republicans leaders who think Obama is a socialist, it's all of them."
 MADDOW:Â  Bush is Hitler.Â  And Obama's Hitler.
 STEWART:Â  No.Â  But it was more about that 9/11 was a chance for Halliburton to get their hands on oil contracts.Â  So, it'sâagain, I take his point.Â  It's a fair point.Â  But I don'tâthat's not exactly what we said.Â  And it's certainly not I thinkâthat's not the seminal thrust of what we were saying.
 Again, the intention was not to say that that's people on the left and that's people on the right.Â  The intention is to say that we've all bought intoâthe conflict on this country is left and right, liberal/conservative, red/blue.Â  All the news networks have been bought into that.
 CNN sort of started it.Â  They have this idea that, you know, the fight in Washington is Republicans and Democrats.Â  So, why don't we isolate that and we'll stand back here?Â  And that'sâyou know, Democrats and Republicans will go at it.Â  Red and blue staters will go at it.
 And what it does it is amplifies a division that I actually don't think is the right fight.Â  But if you're asking me is: do I believe that?Â  What he's saying, that's what I believe?Â  No.
 But what I do believe is: both sides have their way of shutting down debate.Â  And the news networks have allowed these two sides to become the fight in the country.Â  I think the fight in the country is corruption versus not corruption, extremists versus regular.Â  Do you understand what I'm saying?
 MADDOW:Â  Or Harry Truman but then you took that back.
 STEWART:Â  Yes.Â  And I did for good reason, because I don't think he was.Â  I think thatâyou know, again, we have to define our terms.Â  But I think that's such an incendiary charge that when you put it in the conversation asâwell, technically he is.Â  That may be right.Â  But it feels like a conversation stopper, not a conversation starter.
 The complaint was, in the clip reel, we had a woman shouting as an example of dialogue that we were talking about not being helpful.Â  A woman at a meeting shouting, Bush is a war criminal.Â  That's really where that came from, not from saying it in normal conversation.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  We were talking about tone there, not content necessarily.Â  We were talking about standing up in the middle of a meeting and just shouting that.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  -- than red state/blue state.
 MADDOW:Â  But I guess the way Iâand I follow your logic and believe what you're saying up until a point.
 STEWART:Â  I'm glad somebody's following it.
 MADDOW:Â  But I do believe your logic.Â  But itâI mean, the people interrupting meetings and interrupting rallies are direct action activists, who are doing stuff to be purposefully disruptive and a pain to sort of throw a wrench in the works.
 STEWART:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  So, you're saying that it's really nothing?
 MADDOW:Â  Well it's not that it's nothing.Â  It's just not being done with the same level of authority as it is on the rightâlike the Second Amendment remedies thing, that's people running for Senate.
 STEWART:Â  But how did youâhow did you handle town hall meetings when Tea Partiers interrupted the town hall meetings?Â  With the same level of dismissiveness or did you handle with the sense that what's going on with these angry people?Â  Who are these angry people?
 MADDOW:Â  Well, my coverage of that was about it being organized.
 STEWART:Â  OK.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  But, again that isâyour coverage of it was to delegitimize it.Â  That it was actually not real.Â  It was Astroturf.
 MADDOW:Â  No.Â  Actually not.
 STEWART:Â  No?
 MADDOW:Â  It wasâI think my approach to that was to say this is being used as a widespread political tactic by people with a lot of money and a lot of stake in the policy issues and they're sort of deploying direct action activists that we haven't seen before.
 STEWART:Â  Would you say thatâwould you say the general spirit of the block of coverage on MSNBC was as dismissive of the woman who stands up and says Bush is a war criminal or the people at the town hall?Â  Do you think they were viewed through the same prism?
 STEWART:Â  But, again, you areâyou know, they say they identify with the Tea Party.Â  What does that mean?Â  Identify how?Â  Identify with their idea that they like smaller government or identify with yelling at a town hall?
 This isâI'm not sayingâlook, I love the voices that I hear on MSNBC.Â  And there's a difference betweenâhere's what's unfair about what I do.Â  This is really what's a greatâhere's a great thing that I think is unfair.
 You're one person with one great voice and sincereâbut I'm a climate scientist.Â  I study weather patterns and climate.Â  You're talking about the weather.Â  Maybe these networks are not meant to be viewed in aggregate, but there is an aggregate.Â  There is an effect.
 And when people say, well, you're influential, too.Â  I'm a 22-minute show.Â  And when I say, you know, puppets making crank calls in front of me, I don't mean that to diminish comedy.Â  I mean, that is not then re-enforced through the next person.Â  It's not a relay.Â  And there is an amplifying effect to the relay.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  And this is notâyou know, I don'tâI want to make perfectly clear because I think if the argument is you do exactly what FOX do and you're as bad as FOX, anybody who has watched our show in any measure would understand the special place in our hearts for FOX.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  So, again, it feels to me like false equivalent sounds like something that you're doing as well.Â  We have a tendency to grant amnesty to people that we agree with and to overly demonize people we don't.Â  I do the same thing.Â  I think everybody does.
 MADDOW:Â  If you would like to write to me in defense of Code Pink?Â  I'm all ears.Â  I was just trying to make the point about the difference in size of this disrupt the hands brigade on each side.Â  But go ahead, send your hate mail to Rachel@MSNBC.com.Â  I promise to read it.
 And while you're at it, here's a fair warning of what is ahead in my continuing interview with Mr. Stewart.
 STEWART:Â  FOX is not partisan either.Â  They're really not.
 MADDOW:Â  But they never criticized George W. Bush for anything, even when he was not doing things that were not sort of conservative.Â  They never criticized him.
 But they're notâI don't know that they're partisan.
 I have not thrown up once while we've been doing this.Â  And that isâI can believe that maybe the longest in 24 hours that I have gone.Â  You, my friend, are like ginger root.Â  You are the ginger root of interviewers.
 MADDOW:Â  There was, in fact, no barfing, none at all.Â  That and even bigger, better surprises ahead.
 Stay with us.
 MADDOW:Â  There's bigâthere's a lot of people on the right who have made this decision that they'll only talk to media who agrees with them.
 STEWART:Â  That's their greatest triumph.
 STEWART:Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  -- that they can still use it to get their voice out.
 STEWART:Â  You know, I don't think that's a new concept.Â  I don't think that's a Republican or right wing concept.Â  I think they've executed it pretty well.Â  I think Bill Clinton was pretty good at delegitimizing it.
 The great that they've doneâI think the brilliance of FOX News is they delegitimized the idea of editorial authority while exercising incredible editorial authority.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  Which isâit's amazing.Â  And they also have the game that they're all out to get us.Â  So, any criticism of them can be filtered through the idea that it's persecution.Â  It's notâthis isn't criticism, it's persecution.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  And that's a tough distinction to make.Â  But nobody likes to be criticized.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  -- because I made it.
 MADDOW:Â  But then what do you do with the noise?Â  Like, what do you do with Second Amendment remedies?Â  With the Koran-burning pastor?Â  With theâyou know, the terror babies?Â  If you don't cover it, it doesn't go away.
 MADDOW:Â  I think (ph) it's biased.
 STEWART:Â  That's right.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  And so, the answer to that is: why don't we form just a more ideologically network?Â  That's fighting fire with fire to some extent.
 MADDOW:Â  I don't know that that was the answer, though.
 STEWART:Â  No?
 STEWART:Â  Do you think MSNBC has changed over the last five years?Â  You know, there is a genetic linkage between KeithâKeith was the first and it was a voice like in the wilderness.Â  People were like, what?
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  Oh, my God.Â  You can say that?Â  You know?
 And then you came on and Ed.Â  And, again, now, I'm talking about climate as opposed to weather.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  But it does create a linkage that I think it would be hard for you to say, like, geez, I don't know if we're really doing that.Â  And then what are you doing?
 STEWART:Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  -- when Keith spoke out the way he did, he essentially came out of the closet as a liberal.Â  And it didn'tânothing bad happened.Â  It was OK.Â  He still grew his audience, if anything.Â  And so, I think it gave network executives some courage to say, OK, people who are liberals can be on TV as long as they call themselves liberals.Â  And then they hired the rest of us.
 STEWART:Â  Yes, I think that the idea that network executives work on courageâI think what they did is they went, why is FOX News kicking our asses?Â  We need to fight this with a similar or sensationalâyou know, this is an arms race.
 STEWART:Â  That's what I've just said.
 MADDOW:Â  But, no, you said that FOX is beating us.Â  How can we be more like FOX?
 STEWART:Â  Well, no, no.Â  How do weâKeith is making money.Â  And it seems like theâI don't think you can separate the atmosphere of FOX and think that network executives don't look atânothing succeeds like excess or whatever.Â  Nothing exceeds like excess.
 You know, if that was a measured network and a measured tone, I don't think you would see people raising the bar on graphics and all those other things.Â  People are fightingâthe problem with 24-hour news cycle is it's built for a very particular thing, 9/11.Â  Other than that, there really isn't 24 hours of stuff to talk about in the same way.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 O.J.'s not going to kill someone every day.Â  So, that's gone.
 So, what do you have to do?Â  You have to elevate the passion of everything else that happens that might even be somewhat mundane and elevate it to the extent that this is breaking news.Â  This is developing news.Â  This is breaking developing news.
 MADDOW:Â  Just hype, hype, hype.
 STEWART:Â  Right.Â  It was it the language then has to become sharper, louder, to cut through more and more of the noise.Â  And what I'm saying is maybe there is a way to not engage in the idea, not to accept the premise - - there is a premise out there.
 The premise is: we are all on this access of left/right.Â  Maybe there's a different premise.Â  And I don't mean that in the way of partisanship.Â  I mean it in the way ofâthey cover politics.Â  Politics is a Democratic and Republican game.Â  It is left and right.
 I think the conflict that would be more appropriate to a news channel would be corruption and non-corruption.Â  And I don't mean corruption necessarily in the classic sense of this man has $90,000 in his refrigerator.Â  We should really check that out.Â  He's a congressman.Â  That, too.
 It's reallyâyou know, one of my favorite thingsâAnderson Cooper, I think he does a really nice job.Â  He's fun to watch and you as well.Â  And I like on a usual basis, a lot of this stuff.
 Again, I watch way too much of it.Â  I really do.Â  And this is in itself corrupting.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  -- which is just so funny to me because isn't that the subtext ofâit would be like me introducingâI've got a new segment called telling jokes to an audience.Â  It just feltâyou know, whenever you hear that, you're like, isn't that what this whole thing is?
 MADDOW:Â  But that'sâwell, that's only true though if you accept the premise that you're criticizing, which is that the thing to do to attack an audience is to point out conflict, to point hypocrisy, to point things that are wrong.
 STEWART:Â  I think the thing to doâif you are going to add an ingredient to news, and everyone seems toâthere is news, news exists.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  The nightly news, those things.Â  That does exist.Â  If you're adding an ingredient and I think if you're going to be on the air for 24 hours, you're going to need some ingredients.
 MADDOW:Â  None of us are on 24 hours solid.Â  We're all have a piece of it.Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  Well, MSNBC is not even on the weekends.Â  Really?Â  Do I have to see another guy eat another guy's brains on MSNBC in a lockdown cell?
 MADDOW:Â  Yes, you do.
 STEWART:Â  All right.
 But do you what I'm saying?Â  Theâyou have to fill it with other ingredients.Â  So maybe the ingredients would be to not necessarily just amplify that one aspect of the battle.
 STEWART:Â  I agree with that.
 MADDOW:Â  I mean, I am a liberal.Â  It doesn't mean I think of Democrats as being on my team.
 STEWART:Â  No.Â  But FOX is not partisan either.Â  They're really not.
 MADDOW:Â  But they never criticized George W. Bush for anything, even when he was doing things that were sort of not conservative.Â  They never criticized him.
 STEWART:Â  But they're notâbut that'sâthey are ideological but they're notâI don't know that they're partisan.Â  They'reâit certainly falls under Republican (ph) partisanship.Â  But it's notâthere are a lot of Republicans that can't get onboard, that they won't shine their light on.
 MADDOW:Â  So, they'll pick between Republicans, you mean?
 STEWART:Â  I think that's right.
 MADDOW:Â  Would they ever pick a Democrat?
 STEWART:Â  I think they would.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  I think Lieberman would be a guy that they would pick. 
 MADDOW:Â  A Democrat.
 STEWART:Â  Everybody picks people to give themselves cover.Â  You always likeâthe most valuable person in the world is a turncoat.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  Because he's a guy that can come on and you can go, this guy was a Democrat.Â  This guy is a Democrat.Â  Now, he's sitting here saying, you're right.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  Obama is nuts.
 What I'm saying is not so much that the distinctions don't exist, is that they have been so blownâyou talked about proportionality.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  It's surprising to see somebodyâyou know, again, this is the unfair criticism because you're one person.Â  But proportionality is not the strong suit of the 24-hour news networks.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  I always wonder, I think to myself, how would they handle the moon landing?Â  Because could they give it more coverage than they give balloon boy?Â  Because balloon guy was kind of everywhere.Â  So, what would they do?
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  What would their font size be?
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  "The New York times" has a font size.Â  The difference is newspapers and blogs are an active process.Â  You have to look at them.Â  They can make editorial judgment.Â  But you are an active participant in it.Â  You pick where you want to go and where you want to read and how you want to do it.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  The TV tells you.Â  It's a passive experience.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  Our top storyâyou know what's always a great exercise?Â  Look at the difference between the top story on cable news and top story on the newspapers?Â  You would have thought Juan Williams killed people.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 STEWART:Â  It wasâit was everywhere.Â  And what it was, the reason why it was everywhere is because it fellows beautifully into the narrative of left and right, liberal/conservative.Â  It fell perfectly into the only fight that they seem to feel matters.Â  And all I'm saying is, that is, in many ways, a fun house mirror of what actually really matters.
 MADDOW:Â  I went into this interview today with Jon Stewart with a handful of questions about the media and then I was going to say: So, Jon, are you sick of talking about the media?Â  You are?Â  Me, too.Â  Let's talk about Pakistan.
 But there was no getting sick of talking about the media.Â  So, there was no Pakistan.
 But there was an unexpected diversion into trying to understand George W. Bush.
 STEWART:Â  Yes?
 STEWART:Â  Is that what's next?
 STEWART:Â  Is that what happens now?Â  Oh, my God.Â  What happens to me now?
 MADDOW:Â  My interview with Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" today elicited a trouncing (ph) critique from him about the 24-hour cable news world.Â  It also let me get some stuff off my chest.
 STEWART:Â  Right.Â  Right.Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  -- like using humor to tell the story of the wasteful F-35 second engine on that fighter jet.Â  And now, I'm the person trying to be Jon Stewart and sucking.
 STEWART:Â  I love the F-35.Â  That wasteful engine bit.Â  That killed them.Â  It used to be my bit.
 MADDOW:Â  That's ahead.Â  Please stay with us.
 MADDOW:Â  Right.
 And I think you're a person that doesn't like bad arguments. 
 STEWART:Â  Yes. 
 STEWART:Â  Yes.Â  But I think they were like, "Really sad we didn't find anything."
 STEWART:Â  I got the sense that he was like, "Yes.Â  Too bad that report didn't find the weapons that I knew were there."
 MADDOW:Â  The four-by-four one?
 STEWART:Â  Yes.Â  My son very much wants a car.Â  Now, he's six.Â  So he doesn't have a job yet, but he is pursuing a car.Â  He's got to wait a while. 
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  And a lot of things are going to have to happen.Â  Do you get what I'm saying?Â  Like, I get that that's a manipulation.
 STEWART:Â  Yes.
 STEWART:Â  Yes. 
 STEWART:Â  I know.
 MADDOW:Â  Yes.
 MADDOW:Â  No.Â  I mean, nobody's - I'm not saying that.Â  Nobody's saying that.
 STEWART:Â  Right. 
 STEWART:Â  Right. 
 STEWART:Â  I would suggest that it wasn't necessarily just, "This is wrong for the country," but that "You're a bad man."Â  
 STEWART:Â  Maybe. 
 MADDOW:Â  "That could very well be," he says, or - yes, there's more.Â  Stay with us.Â  More with my interview with Jon Stewart ahead.
 MADDOW:Â  The raw tape of my interview with Jon Stewart is online as of tomorrow morning at "MaddowBlog.MSNBC.com."Â  It includes his reflections on the success of his big rally in D.C. with Stephen Colbert.Â  MaddowBlog.MSNBC.com.Â  More ahead.
 MADDOW:Â  Do you think that "The Daily Show" functions just as 
 STEWART:Â  Yes. 
 STEWART:Â  Right. 
 MADDOW:Â  Even if you're not launching it in the same way, it's being received in the same way.Â  And the barriers between what actually happens on cable news that you're satirizing and what you're doing - we're not seeing as being all that different.Â  Does that worry you?
 MADDOW:Â  That's kind of a news flash, right?Â  "The Daily Show" no longer wishes to be considered fake news.Â  They'd like to be considered as not news at all.Â  I still think it's news.
 The finale ahead including me getting a talking-to about the word "teabag." 
 STEWART:Â  Right. 
 MADDOW:Â  You don't think it was funny that they were calling - they were saying, "Teabag the White House before the White House teabags you?"
 MADDOW:Â  Yes. 
 MADDOW:Â  Yes. 
 MADDOW:Â  Took the joke too far. 
 MADDOW:Â  How?Â  What's the difference?Â  What's the material difference?
 The next thing I can do is step onto the field and go, "So now, here's what we're going to do, people.Â  Jones, you go over there.Â  Brooklyn, you grab the canteens.Â  We're going to have to -" but I don't.Â  
 STEWART:Â  Right. 
 STEWART:Â  Right.
 MADDOW:Â  And the examples that are culled, you know, whether it is Alan Grayson yelling on the floor of the House or it's Code Pink interrupting a rally are not equivalent to Sharron Angle saying if conservatives don't get what they want, they're going to use guns to get what they want and she's a U.S. Senate candidate.Â  
 MADDOW:Â  It's like I remember right after the 2000 election - and I won't keep you here forever.Â  I'm sorry.Â  Right after the election, you said something that - something I remember it was about George Bush and Dick Cheney right after Bush versus Gore said something to the effect of Bush said, can we have the recession outside today because the weather is so nice, with the idea being that George Bush is an idiot.Â  He's an infantile person that thinks "recess" and "recession" are the same thing.Â  
 And after the "teabag the White House before they tea bag you" sign goes on Fox News, we talk about what the whole idea is about teabagging and how funny they don't get what that word choice means.Â  
 MADDOW:Â  Yes. 
 MADDOW:Â  Yes. 
 It was really nice of Jon Stewart to come over here to do the interview with the stomach flu and everything.Â  I'm as much as a fan as I ever was.Â  The full, untrimmed, to too long for TV discussion will be posted on at MaddowBlog.MSNBC.com tomorrow morning. 
 That does it for us tonight.Â  Thank you for watching.Â  "THE LAST WORD" with Lawrence O'Donnell starts right now.
