<p><strong>INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT: This is a rush transcript. Check against video for accuracy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>reason:</strong> Let's talk about the state of contemporary feminism. You have been in a public life or in an intellectual life since the late 1960s, a proud feminist, often reviled by other feminists. Gloria Steinem most famously said you were an anti-feminist and that when you denied that, she said that would be like a Nazi saying they're not anti-Semitic. You're mixing it up. What is going on with the state of "professional feminism" in this country. It seems if you look at from, say, the early '70s, things have gotten better for women. Men are less uptight about gender roles. Women are more in the workforce, they get paid equally, sexual assaults and sexual violence are down. In so many ways, things are going better than ever, and yet from sites like <em>Jezebel</em> or <em>Feministing</em>, all you hear is that things have never been worse.</p>

<p><strong>Paglia:</strong> Feminism has gone through many phases. Obviously the woman's suffrage movement of the 19 century fizzled after women gained the right to vote through the Constitutional amendment in 1920. Then the movement revived in the late 1960s through Betty Freidan co-founding NOW in 1967. Now, I preceded all that. I'm on record with a letter in <em>Newsweek</em>, I was in high school in 1963, where I called for equal rights for American women and so on. I began thinking about gender, researching it, I loved the generation of Amelia Earhart and all those emancipated women of the '20s and '30s, and because I had started my process of thought about gender so much earlier, I was out of sync with the women's movement when it suddenly burst forth.</p>

<p><strong>Paglia:</strong> It was literally nothing. There was no political activism of any kind from women getting the right to vote in 1920â¦ when Simone de Beauvoir wrote her great magnum opus, <em>The Second Sex</em>, published in the early 1950s, she was thought to be hopelessly retrograde. Nobody could possibly be interested again in gender issues.</p>

<p><strong>reason:</strong> You were living in upstate New York. Did you already know what your sexuality was? What was it like to be a woman, a lesbian, in 1963?</p>

<p><strong>Paglia:</strong> Well, the 1950s were a highly conformist period. Gender had repolarized after really great gains it seems to me in the '20s and '30s, and one must be more sympathetic to the situation of my parents' generation. They had known nothing but depression and war throughout their entire lives. My father was a paratrooper, when he got out of the army, everyone married, and I'm the baby boom. They wanted normality. They just wanted to live like real people, man and wife in a home. I found the 1950s utterly suffocating. I was a gender nonconforming entity, and I was signaling my rebellion by these transgender Halloween costumes that were absolutely unheard of. I was five, six, seven, eight years old. My parents allowed me to do it because I was so intent on it.</p>

<p><strong>reason:</strong> What were you dressing up as?</p>

<p><strong>Paglia:</strong> A Roman solider, the matador from <em>Carmen</em>. My best was Napoleon. I was Hamlet from the Classics Comics book. Absolutely no one was doing stuff like this, and I'm happy that this talk about medical sex changes was not in the air, because I would have become obsessed with that and assumed that that was my entire identity and problem, so this is why I'm very concerned about the rush to surgical interventions today. At any rate, I was attracted to menâI dated menâbut I just fell in love with women and always have. Yes, there's absolutely no doubt. I was on the forefront of gay identification. When I arrived at graduate school at Yale 1968-1972, I was theÂ <em>only</em> openly gay person, and I didn't even have a sex life. To me, it was a badge of militance. And I was the only person doing a dissertation on a sexual topic. It's hard to believe this now.</p>

<p><strong>reason:</strong> What was the topic?</p>

<p><strong>Paglia:</strong> Sexual personae, which was the book <em>finally</em> published in 1990 after being rejected by seven publishers and five agents, and that was unheard of again. I'm delighted I had the sponsorship of Harold Bloom that pushed the topic through the English department, I think possibly that they allowed me to do such a thing on sex was actually kind of amazing.</p>

<p>My clashes with other feminists began immediately. For example, it was 1970 or 1971, there was a feminist conference at the Yale Law School, and major feminists were there including [the author] Rita Mae Brown, who said to me, "The difference between you and me, Camille, is that you want to save the universities, and I want to burn them down." How can you have dialogue with these people? Later she became a rich lesbian novelist and has a horse farm in Virginia. And then I had a screaming fight with the New Haven Women's Liberation Rock Band over The Rolling Stones, because at that time, hard rock was seen as sexist. Now, this argument seems so retrograde.</p>
