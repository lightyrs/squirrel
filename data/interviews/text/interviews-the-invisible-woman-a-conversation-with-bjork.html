<div class="inner"><p class="p1"><strong>Pitchfork: Who are confessional singer/songwriters that you like?</strong></p>

<p class="p1">B: Funnily enough, with my favorite music like that, I don't understand the words. I really like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fado">fado</a> singers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke2F9vwpOCA">AmÃ¡lia Rodrigues</a>, but I don't speak Portuguese. [<em>laughs</em>] I really like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH8BgubvXWM">Abida Parveen</a> from Pakistan, but I don't understand a word she sings either. As for American singers, you know who I've loved almost since my childhood? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm_cFzVAoo8">Chaka Khan</a>. <em>I love Chaka Khan</em>. I've totally fallen in love with a remix album of hers from the '80s. I don't know if it's a guilty pleasure. It's just pleasure. Obviously, I really love <a href="http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17269-the-studio-albums-1968-1979/">Joni Mitchell</a>. I think it was that accidental thing in Iceland, where the wrong albums arrive to shore, because I was obsessed with <em>Don Juan's Reckless Daughter</em> and <em>Hejira </em>as a teenager. I hear much more of <em>her</em> in those albums. She almost made her own type of music style with those, it's more a woman's world.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Pitchfork: <em>Hejira</em> is one the most feminist albums ever.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">B: Right? The lyrics! AndÂ <em>The Hissing of Summer Lawns</em> as well. I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF2_1Jfgo4I">"The Jungle Line"</a>, it sounds like something somebody would make now, it's crazy. Maybe it's because it's not my generation, but when I hear the folk stuff that she did before that, I hear it as a lot of people and not just her. It's a zeitgeist.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Pitchfork: When it was originally misreported that <em>Vulnicura</em> was produced by Arca, instead of co-produced by you and Arca, it reminded me of the Joni Mitchell quote from the height of her fame about how whichever man was in the room with her got credit for her genius.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">B: Yeah, I didn't want to talk about that kind of thing for 10 years, but then I thought, "You're a coward if you don't stand up. Not for you, but for women. Say something." So around 2006, I put something on my website where I cleared something up, because it'd been online so many times that it was becoming a fact. It wasn't just one journalist getting it wrong, <em>everybody</em> was getting it wrong. I've done music for, what, <em>30 years</em>? I've been in the studio since I was 11; Alejandro had never done an album when I worked with him. He wanted to put something on his own Twitter, just to say it's co-produced. I said, "No, we're never going to win this battle. Let's just leave it." . I've sometimes thought about releasing a map of all my albums and just making it clear who did what. But it always comes across as so defensive that, like, it's pathetic. I could obviously talk about this for a long time.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Pitchfork: The world has a difficult time with the female auteur.</strong></p>

<p class="p1">B: I have nothing against Kanye West. Help me with thisâI'm not dissing himâthis is about how people talk about him. With the last album he did, he got all the best beatmakers on the planet at the time to make beats for him. A lot of the time, he wasn't even there. Yet no one would question his authorship <em>for a second</em>. If whatever I'm saying to you now helps women, I'm up for saying it. For example, I did 80% of the beats on <em>Vespertine </em>and itÂ took me <em>three years</em> to work on that album, because it was all microbeatsâit was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came in the last two weeks and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited <em>everywhere </em>as having done the whole album. [Matmos'] Drew [Daniel] is a close friend of mine, and in every single interview he did, he corrected it. And they don't even listen to him. It really is strange.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Pitchfork: How does it make you feel when this happens now?</strong></p>

<p class="p1">B: I have to sayâI got a feeling I am going to win in the long run, but I want to be part of the zeitgeist, too. I want to support young girls who are in their 20s now and tell them: <em>You're not just imagining things</em>. It's tough. Everything that a guy says once, you have to say five times. Girls now are also faced with different problems. I've been guilty of one thing: After being the only girl in bands for 10 years, I learnedâthe hard wayâthat if I was going to get my ideas through, I was going to have to pretend that theyâmenâhad the ideas. I became really good at this and I don't even notice it myself. I don't really have an ego. I'm not that bothered. I just want the whole thing to be good. And I'm not saying one bad thing about the guys who were with me in the bands, because they're all amazing and creative, and they're doing incredible things now. But I come from a generation where <em>that</em> was the only way to get things done. So I have to play stupid and just do everything with five times the amount of energy, and then it will come through.Â </p>

<p class="p2">When people don't credit me for the stuff I've done, it's for several reasons. I'm going to get very methodical now! [<em>laughs</em>] One! I learned what a lot of women have to do is make the guys in the room think it was <em>their</em> idea, and then you back them up. Two! I spend 80% of the writing process of my albums on my own. I write the melodies. I'm by the computer. I edit a lot. That for me is very solitary. I don't want to be photographed when I'm doing that. I don't invite people around. The 20% of the album process when I bring in the string orchestras, the extras, that's documented more. That's the side people see. When I met M.I.A., she was moaning about this, and I told her, "Just photograph yourself in front of the mixing desk in the studio, and people will go, 'Oh, OK! A woman with a tool, like a man with a guitar.'" Not that I've done that much myself, but sometimes you're better at giving people advice than doing it yourself. I remember seeing a photo of Missy Elliott at the mixing desk in the studio and being like,Â <em>a-ha!</em></p>

<p class="p3">It's a lot of what people <em>see</em>. During a show, because there are people onstage doing the other bits, I'm <em>just a singer</em>. For example, I asked Matmos to play all the beats for the <em>Vespertine </em>tour, so maybe that's kind of understandable that people think they made them. So maybe it's not <em>all</em> sexist evil.Â [<em>laughs</em>] But it's an ongoing battle. I hope it doesn't come across as too defensive, but it is the truth. I definitely can feel the third or fourth feminist wave in the air, so maybe this is a good time to open that Pandora's box a little bit and air it out.</p>
