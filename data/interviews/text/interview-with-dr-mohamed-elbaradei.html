<div id="Copy">  <ul> <li> <a href="/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleUid=7903940E-BDD2-4464-9FAA-C14D49009BD7">Watch film</a></li> </ul> <p> Nick Clarke, interviewer (NC)Â I'm Nick Clarke, an anchor with Al Jazeera English and I'm here to conduct an interview with Dr ElBaradei, a distinguished lawyer and diplomat who served three terms with the International Atomic Energy Agency and now has presidential ambitions in Egypt.</p>

 <p> Â Dr ElBaradei, welcome.Â  First of all, if I may ask you, you returned to Egypt in 2010 and we at Al Jazeera followed you very closely.Â  We followed your tweets, we listened to what you had to say, we interviewed you on occasions, and you were saying that you believed that 2011 would be a pivotal year, a year that would see a great deal of change.Â  In terms of the actual revolution, as far as Egypt was concerned, were you surprised by the magnitude of what happened?</p>

 <p> Dr Mohamed ElBaradei (MEB)Â Frankly, not, Nick.Â  I mean I thought the major hurdle is to go through the uprising and that was not really a premonition.Â  I think, you know, the writing was on the wall, that things were going very badly in terms of repression, in terms of corruption, in terms of obscene gap between the rich and the poor, poverty, you name it.Â  I mean total lack of good governance, you know, and it was just a question of when.</p>

   <p> Â What the military have done is to start to say we will first go through a parliamentary election and then that parliamentary election would elect a constituent assembly to write the constitution.Â  That frankly started the whole constitutional mess we are going through.Â  That's part of the problems, you know, but then you have realised that people, after so many years you know, of poverty, lack of health service, lack of education, that's an unrealistic expectation.Â  People thought, "Well, we are now free.Â  You know, we have now regained our country so we'd like to see instant 'cash' and of course the government doesn't have the money and particularly that ...</p>

 <p> NCÂ Or the experience.</p>

  <p> Â Security for some reason was part of the old regime.Â  They decided to disband it.Â  They decided to maybe even become sort of a counter-revolution, showing the people, "Well, if you want your freedom, here is the price: total chaos and lack of security", and with the lack of security you can imagine that investors are not going to flock into Egypt or the tourists are coming in.Â  That again, that links to what I am saying, that unless you have the money, you cannot start a programme of social justice or, you know, raising the standard of living.Â  So we are in a way of a vicious circle.Â  You know, we don't have the money because we don't have the security and, if we don't have the money, we are not able to meet some of the expectations and, at the end of the day, we're still going through a very ... a roadmap that is very vague and very opaque.Â  You know, we don't know when exactly we are going to have the constitution, whether the presidential election is going to take place this year or next year.Â  Are we going to have another parliamentary election after the new constitution?Â </p>

 <p> Â It's a bit of a mess, frankly, and that's the kind of situation obviously I did not expect.Â  I thought that we will follow a logical, you know, smooth transition.Â  It could have taken a year or two but at least clear and when we get a logical step-by-step approach and that's not unfortunately what's happening.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Of course, emerging from the throes of revolution is always going to be a challenge for all these countries but there are those who are still engaged.Â  Libya is just emerging.Â  We have Syria, we have Yemen - it's across the region.</p>

   <p> Â We get a lot of goodwill from everybody but we have to do it ourselves.Â  We need that international assistance, financial assistance, you know, assistance to civil society which is very weak, how to establish parties, how to engage - you know, engage the people - but we have to do it on the right track.Â  I'm still optimistic.Â  I mean I've talked to a number of people who have gone through the process in Eastern Europe and Latin America and said, "Don't despair".Â  You know, it's usually it gets worse before it gets better.Â  In Portugal, for example, you know, the foreign Prime Minister of Portugal told me, "We almost went Communist after 1974" and it took them at least a couple of years because they adjust the process and finally, you know, they became a country that is part of Europe in 1986 after they joined the European Union.Â  So it takes time and one has to be patient but, to tell people to be patient after what they have gone through, to tell people, "Wait", that requires trust, requires transparency.Â  It's something that I'm not used to because they have government for the last six years offering all the time, you know, that things will become better the day after and they have never seen that.Â </p>

 <p> Â So we need to continue to talk.Â  You know, the key issue frankly to me right now is to establish credibility on transparency and tell people, "Yes, we have problems.Â  That's what's happening and that's what is not going to happen tomorrow but we are on the right track".</p>

 <p> NCÂ Okay.Â  I'm going to come back to Egypt a little bit later but right now I just want to spin back in time to the build-up to the Iraq war in 2003. You were of course head of the IAEA at the time, searching in Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.Â  You didn't find any but war, as we know, happened and you wrote about this time, "The thought that would not leave my head was the certainty that nothing Hans Blix [you were working together], nothing that Hans Blix or I had seen could possibly justify going to war".Â  How do you reflect on that time now, bearing in mind what happened?</p>

  <p> Â Well hopefully we'll learn some lesson from that, that war is not the solution.Â  War in fact does not heal old wounds, it opens new ones.Â  We are only left with dialogue, diplomacy, based on respect and understanding where each party is coming from.Â  That is the kind of message I keep sending in there.Â  Confrontation right now between the West and Iran, there is no military option.Â Â  The only way is to sit around the table and find a way to split the difference and be able to live together.</p>

 <p> NCÂ But was the Iraq war needless?Â  Perhaps there was a need for Saddam Hussein to go.</p>

  <p> Â As I said, it was not based on really Iraq or Saddam Hussein being a threat.Â  He was clearly a threat to his people but not a threat to his neighbours.Â  I mean he was ... that regime was dilapidated at that time but it was a question of, "Let us ..."Â  You know, after 9/11, I think that's, "We need to show strength.Â  We need to show that we can beat an Arab or Muslim country".Â  Afghanistan was sort of side-tracked but Iraq was chosen.Â  As Saddam Hussein was defying the West and they thought - you know, some of the newcons[?] obviously in Washington - that this is the target.Â  With the fantasy, as I said, that Iraq was a secular estate at that time and with a lot of educated elite and that Iraq will be radiating democracy and freedom to the rest of the Arab world.Â  Unfortunately, the complete opposite happened.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Is it a surprise to you that the principle players in this - the Bush's of this world, Tony Blair and so forth - still stand by their decisions without any apparent introspection or self-examination?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I'm surprised not only that they have, still defending their decisions.Â  I'm quite surprised and shocked that they have not been held accountable.Â  I mean we cannot ... and here we are, you know, in a forum dealing with international law.Â  You cannot just apply law to the Milosevic or to the Bashirs of the world, the weak and the defeated.Â  Unless you apply law across the board, unless somebody is held accountable in the US and in the UK as who decided to go to war and on what basis and if that was an act of deception or based on misinformation, whatever ...Â  We need people to be accountable.Â  Otherwise, you know, how could you get anybody to respect international law or legal norm?Â  Then it's a question of a bunch of rules designed to protect the strong and the victorious.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Right.Â  And you need institutions.Â  You need institutions like the IAEA but doesn't what happened in Iraq demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the IAEA at that time?Â  It was pretty toothless.Â  You guys were all taking it extremely seriously, clearly, but the politicians just overrode everything you said.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well this has to do, Nick, with the whole question of global governance, frankly, right now.Â  I mean I think we are globalised in a very fast ... on a fast track, globalised in everywhere.Â  I mean there is not an issue I can think of - financial crisis, climate change, arms control, communicable diseases - I don't see any issue that any one country alone can resolve on its own, including Iraq, as we have seen, with all the might of the American ...Â  You know, it turned it into a complete mess and international institution is part of that.Â </p>

 <p> Â You know, I can't think right now of any effective mechanism for governance.Â  We are globalising in a fast track and we are lagging behind in terms of devising, getting that mechanism to govern, in tandem with the fast track we are going through.Â  If you look at the UN Security Council, it's pretty much, in my view, dysfunctional in many ways.Â  The UN in many ways dysfunctional, the G8, the G20, the EU, the Arab League - and that's part of the problem.Â  Yes, of course, if you give international institutions the required authority, we will function better, and even in the case of Iraq.Â  Mind you, we had all the authorities - IAEA and Hans Blix.Â  You know, the UN Commission for Biological and Chemical - we had all those authorities, we had god's word, authority at that time, you know, by the Security Council, but then we're not taken seriously.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Yeah, exactly.Â  I was just going to say.Â  So in the days before the war Dick Cheney said, "We believe Saddam Hussein has in fact reconstituted nuclear weapons" and he said, "I think Mr ElBaradei, frankly, is wrong".Â  What did you think at that time?Â  How did you receive that news?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well I mean, the first time I met Dick Cheney - you know, before the war - he said that we ...Â  You know, I met him with Hans Blix and that's actually in my book.Â  He said, "We are ready to work with you but we are ready to discredit the inspection to disarm Iraq".Â  So the message is, you know, unless you follow what we think is the right way to go, we're in it to discredit you and, you know, he came with a number of statements - he and others - that we are wrong, our record is terrible, and I ...</p>

 <p> NCÂ So the IAEA was toothless at the time.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Yeah, and I'm still yet waiting for at least a word of apology from Mr Cheney, but all he said, as far as I read, that he misspoke.Â  He misspoke on issue of war and peace that has a disastrous result that we are still living with.</p>

 <p> NCÂ The truth is, of course, is that the Iraqis could have shown a lot more transparency.Â  They were clearly out to mislead.</p>

  <p> Â We knew that because, you know, in the 1990s, we were there and we eliminated all their WMD's problem - weapons of mass destruction problem - but, correct, they were not forthcoming.Â  And I think it was a question for them that they knew the war was coming, and that's what they told us.Â  You know, that the war was inevitable.Â  For some reason, they realised that, no matter what they do, and the only thing they wanted to keep is their dignity.Â  Mind you also, with a very centralised regime, it was very slow.Â  You know, they could not take a single decision before going all the way to Saddam Hussein at that time.Â  However, we made lots of progress in four months and I remember at the Security Council I asked for three more months as an investment in peace.Â  You know, because we didn't see an imminent threat, as they say, and we were just ignored and sidelined.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Can you draw a parallel with Iran now, with what's going on now, in the sense of this obfuscation that's coming from Iran?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Very much so.Â  You know, again there is obfuscation.Â  There is ...Â  The Iranians are dragging their feet.Â  They are not the most transparent in many ways but we haven't seen - and I still, even two years out of the IAEA - we haven't seen really Iran being an imminent threat, or we haven't seen them actually building a nuclear weapon.Â  I know that the Iranian issue, it will only be resolved if Iran and the US would sit around the table and work on a grand bargain.Â  I mean they both need each other very much.Â  The Iranians need the US and the West for technology, for trade, and they want to be recognised as a regional power, and they are a regional power.Â  The US clearly and the West need Iran very much - in Iraq and Afghanistan, in Palestine, in Syria, Lebanon.Â  So it's a win-win situation but it's a question to me until now is, "Who is going to blink first?" and it's a question of how much domestic politics influence a rational foreign policy decision.Â </p>

 <p> Â We were very close a couple of years ago to cut a deal but then in Iran it was after election, you know, tremor, if you like, and it was pay-back time at that time.Â  Then, when the Iranians put their act together and there was a Turkish-Brazilian initiative to get things started, Barack Obama got mired into the healthcare system and the tea parties.Â  So we still see a lot of domestic policies impact irrational decision on approaching Iran, from both sides.Â  I'm still hopeful that both sides will realise sooner or later - and I hope sooner - that, if you want to establish peace in the Middle East, and that's something now we have ...</p>

 <p> Â We have a unique opportunity, frankly, right now and I've been telling everybody, Nick, that you need very much Iran to be on the right side of things right now.Â  When you see what's happening - the explosion in Libya, in Syria and Yemen - you need the kind of Turkey, the kind of Iran, the Muslim large countries in the Middle East, working in tandem with the rest of the international community, to make sure that the Middle East finally will be at peace with itself.Â  This is a unique opportunity and that's also addressed to Israel.Â  I mean this is the first real opportunity for Israel to have peace with the Arab people and not with dictators and they need to not just talk the talk, but walk the walk, both the Israelis - in terms of adjusting their policies - and also the US, which is very much close in the policy approach to the Israelis.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Do you think Iran is developing nuclear weapons?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I don't think so.Â  This is my gut feeling, however.Â  You know, my gut feeling that they would like to have the technology to be able to develop nuclear weapons in a short span of time, meaning having that capability to enrich uranium, so they will be able to develop a weapon - say in a few months - but stop short of developing nuclear weapons.Â  I don't think they need to develop nuclear weapons.Â  They are smart enough to realise, if they were to develop nuclear weapons, they'd get themselves into, you know, a really terrible situation.Â  But they can continue to be cautious, saying, "We have the technology.Â  It's permissible, legal, under the Non-Proliferation Treaty" but sending the message at the same time to all their neighbours and the rest of the world, "Don't mess up with us because we can develop nuclear weapons".Â  They are not different from Japan or Brazil or Germany or countries that have the technology but they are not necessarily going for nuclear weapons.</p>

 <p> NCÂ You mentioned your book.Â  I'm intrigued by its title. "The Age of Deception", you call it, but wasn't it ever thus from Pharaonic times to the present day?Â  Politics, diplomacy has been all about deception, hasn't it?Â  Things are just no different to how they have always been in human affairs and world affairs.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ No.Â  I'm not surprised that it has always been deception, you know, but I wanted to share with the public at least how my years with the IAEA was mired with deception and how deception does not lead to peace or security.Â  We have seen that in Iraq.Â  We have seen that in Iran.Â  We have seen that in North Korea.Â  Everybody is trying to deceive each other.Â  Everybody thinks it's a zero sum game and, you know, I can get a little bit extra and that's not the way.Â  I mean, unless we restore diplomacy to a process based on decency, honesty, fact, truth, we will not win.Â  Particularly, as I said, at a time now we are so much linked together that you will not be able to run away with things and leave the others behind.Â  The lesson I am saying is - in that book, or trying at least to say in that book - is that we need to change the whole paradigm of how we conduct international affairs because we either are going to win together, all of us, or we are going to fall separately, and that's the way I see it today.</p>

 <p> NCÂ With respect, isn't it easy to say, "We need to fly the flag of transparency, of honest diplomacy" but the reality is just very different and how you effect that change that you talk about.Â  Clearly, it's a good thing if it can happen but how can it happen?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well, Nick, you need to get more people to speak up on these issues.Â  I mean I did at least - you know, during my years there - and I was subject to every vilification you can imagine from everybody (you know, from the US, from Iran, from Iraq, from North Korea) but you try.Â  You try because you think you are on the right track and you want to guide things to be on the right track, but it is not a question of one person.Â  I think civil society has a lot to do.Â  So far, security issues have been left to governments to say, "This is too complicated".Â  Public civil society has been engaged in trade, environment, but never really in defence and questions of war and peace.Â  Like why do we have 23,000 warheads, nuclear warheads, today?Â  I think it's about time now that civil society gets really engaged and tells government.Â  Our security, our survival, is too important to be left to government.Â  Hopefully that will happen one day but I haven't ...Â  Of course, I agree with you, you know, it's a long-term process but we have to start somewhere.</p>

 <p> NCÂ To help that along, you need to give more authority, you said, to organisations like the IAEA but is that possible?Â  What kind of authority do you mean - a legal authority to implement and to punish, if people transgress?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ We have to have an authority to inspect, authority to get information, authority to get access, and ...</p>

 <p> NCÂ You do, in theory, have that.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ We do, in theory, in the case of Iraq but in the case of the rest of the world, we don't have all the authority we need.Â  The more authority we have, the more teeth we have and the more ability to provide assurance to the international community and that applies to everywhere.Â  I mean look at the Security Council.Â  It's on again, off again.Â  Look to the Human Rights Committee, it's on again, off again.Â  Â I mean politics, in a sinister way, is always part of the process.Â  You know, are these guys my friends?Â  If they are my friends, I have to be soft with them.Â  I mean, again, we have to apply the same standard across the board.Â  Unless we establish a system based on universal legal norms that does not differentiate between the rich and the poor, the weak and the strong, as I said, we will not move forward very much.Â  The world right now, in my view, is very much rudderless.Â  You know, it's ...Â  I look at everywhere.Â  I look at climate change.Â  We all know it's going to be a pending disaster.Â  What are we going to do about it?Â  We know that the spread of nuclear weapons is a threat, particularly if it goes to extremist groups.Â  We know that HIV/AIDS, ten million people are dying because they don't have access to medication because it's too strong.Â  You look at Somalia, 750,000 people are dying from famine.Â  I mean you look everywhere.Â  These are issues that we can deal with but we are not.Â  We are not because we keeping wringing our hands and waiting for somebody, or a miracle to happen.Â  It's not going to happen unless we all start to take individual responsibility, if you like.Â  Each person of us will start to say, "What can I do to create a better world that I can leave for the next generation?"</p>

 <p> NCÂ If we look to the nuclear future, if I can put it that way.Â  You talked about right now as the world being on the cusp of significant change.Â  What do you mean by that?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well I mean by ...Â  Are you talking about nuclear weapons or ...?</p>

 <p> NCÂ Yeah, nuclear weapons.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Nuclear weapons.Â  Well I think nuclear weapons ...Â  We can't live on the basis of a global security system that relies on the haves and have-nots.Â  You know, we have nine nuclear weapon states that continue to say that we need nuclear weapons for our security but nobody else can touch it.Â  Well that is not sustainable because the technology's out of the tube, as we have seen with the ECU[inaudible] Corporation, or Walmart.Â  So any country, irrespective of its regime, whether you call it "rogue" - I don't like that word - but whether you call it rogue or democratic, any country that feels that its threatened will go to develop nuclear weapons because they say, you know, "If the big boys are developing nuclear weapons for their own security, for their own insurance against attack, why can't we?"Â  If we do that, then the prophesy of John F Kennedy that we'll see 20, 25 or 30 countries with nuclear weapons will come true.Â  If we do that, this is the sure way of self-destruct, that we definitely will see nuclear weapons used either by default or intentionally, and that's not the kind of world we would like to live in.Â </p>

 <p> Â I'm not surprised if you see that, that people like Henry Kissinger or George Shultz or Bill [inaudible] or some nun - people who have been in the middle of the Cold War, in the middle of the mad mutual-assured destruction, Syrian-concept - are now apostles of disarmament.Â  These guys are not naive, are not blue-eyed idealists.Â  I mean they realise that, continue on the road relying on nuclear weapons is, as they say, increasingly ineffective and extremely hazardous.Â  So we need to take a new look, a new approach.</p>

 <p> NCÂ What does that mean?Â  Does that mean changing the parameters of the Non-Proliferation Treaty?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Changing the ground, having a global system that does not rely on nuclear weapons but at the same time having a system that can detect and defeat any possible cheaters.Â  That requires re-engineering the Security Council, re-engineering the global governance.Â  You know, the different institutions we talked about.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Collective security comes with willingness from all the parties, doesn't it?Â  And you cannot necessarily generate that, certainly not amongst perhaps more extremist groups.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ No but we all have to co-operate to defeat extremist groups.Â  We all know that this is a common enemy and I think also, Nick, if countries like the US, the European Union, Russia, China, take the lead - and the large countries, India - take the lead by example (by showing that, yes we can keep our security without relying on weapons of mass destruction.Â  You know, yes we can develop a global security system where we put the emphasis on co-operation and not confrontation), I think we can do it but this is a completely ...Â  As I said, it's a completely new paradigm and we cannot just try to work through using Band Aid.Â  Band Aid, at this stage, is not going to work, in my view.</p>

 <p> NCÂ So what is the solution: you tear up the old system and start again?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I think we tear up the old system and we say, "The world has changed and we need to change and we need to take absolutely a fresh look, a fresh approach".Â  We have to change our mindset.Â  We have to understand that now.Â  We are, you know, one human family, more than at any time before, that we can only live if we take care of each other.Â  You know, the old question in the Bible, "Am I my brother's keeper?" very much comes to the fore right now.Â  Until we understand that we are - every one of us is - his brother's and sister's keeper, unless we understand that and not try to look as protagonists or antagonists, unless we change the mindset, I think, in my view, we are doomed.Â  We are doomed in ... and I hope that's not going to happen but it's a warning, at least the way I see it based on many years of dealing with deception.</p>

 <p> NCÂ How do you tackle extremism?Â  You can tackle poverty, to a degree, you can tackle governance.Â  You can improve governance, in theory at least, but how do you tackle this issue of extremist religious ideology?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well I think extremism is a result of a sense of marginalisation, a sense of unfair treatment, a sense of double standards.Â  It's very much linked to corruption, to a lack of good governance.Â  Get people engaged, raise their standard of living, make sure that they're - rather than thinking of suicide bombing - thinking of having a new job and an apartment, a holiday.Â  I think treat people like human beings, they'll act like human beings.Â  It doesn't mean that we will never have ...Â  We'll continue to have waves of extremists, even in industrialised developed countries, as we have seen in Italy, for example, or in Germany, but we will have to continue to engage these people, educate these people, change their mindset.Â  It's not an easy task but, as I said, if we try to make them feel that we do care about them, we do care about their concerns or perceptions of injustice, rightly or wrongly, and engage them, we should be able to move them at least.Â  Rather than use weapons, use the power of the argument and that's what we would like to see.Â  We would always have our differences but we should not use the argument of power.Â  You know, we use the power of the argument.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Perception of unfairness that you mentioned there, it's very important, isn't it, to ensure that people feel that they're being treated in the same way as people from another country?Â  And you talk about the UN Security Council and how that's failing.Â  Clearly, when you have a different approach to, say, Libya than you do to apparently Syria or Yemen, then those grievances are well-founded, aren't they?</p>

  <p> Â The question is: are we looking for a security system based on Euro-Atlantic concept of security or are we looking for a global security system based on human solidarity?Â  What you said about Libya, Syria and Yemen is very true.Â  Why did we apply a no-fly zone in Libya?Â  Why do we keep ... you know, continue to see the killing in Syria and Yemen and continue to wring our hands?Â  The lack of uniform standard, the lack of respect for the sanctity of human life, which at the end of the day, to me, is much more important than borders, language and nationalities.Â  It's sanctity of the human life everywhere, wherever it exists.</p>

 <p> NCÂ In this region, Saudi Arabia's role is pivotal.Â  Not only in this region, worldwide too.Â  Do you see that changing in any way because what is happening?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I think it's changing and, again, I think the change in the region is ...Â  As I say, the train has left the station.Â  There's no going back.Â  The question is we would like to see it happening through evolution and not explosion.Â  I don't like to see the Libyan model.Â  I'd like to see the Egyptian and Tunisian model.Â  Tunisia is going in a very logical pathway to a democracy, as I see it.Â  You know, much better even than what we have in Egypt right now but Egypt, as I said, is key because, if we do that, we will be a beacon of change through evolution and not through explosion.Â  I see change happening in Saudi Arabia.Â  I see change happening everywhere in the Arab world but I would like to see even people in power taking the initiative, you know, to change, rather than wait for uprising.Â  Saudi Arabia and Egypt eventually - two of the largest countries in the region - could, working together, have a pivotal role in unifying the Arab world, on the basis of different values of co-operation (freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom from fear, from want), and link up the Middle East, hopefully, with Turkey, with Iran, with Israel, linking up as a region based on co-operation and stability and connected with the rest of the world, rather than talking about this bogus clash of civilisation.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Let me just take two examples here.Â  This change that's winding its course through the region, do you think that's going to have a significant impact on, say, first of all, women's rights?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Oh, definitely.Â  I mean in any system based on equal rights, democracy, freedom of speech, women of course that have been suppressed or treated as second-class citizens in many part of this region will obviously have to have a different standing.Â  It will obviously have ... it will have a major change in the way ...Â  You know, the whole change is not just about change of personalities, it's a change of mindset, if you like.Â  How do we talk about freedom of religion?Â  How do we interpret freedom of religion?Â  How do we interpret freedom of speech?Â  How we interpret freedom from fear, from want and women's rights, handicaps.Â  There is a lot.Â  I mean you start, hopefully, in a democracy, on the basis of equality and respect for universal values and that has to come and will come.Â  It's just a question of time.</p>

 <p> NCÂ You feel that really will happen in Saudi Arabia, that women will start to gain more right, there will be more freedom in the press, for example, more freedom of information?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I think so.Â  Again, it's a question of speed, it's a question of pace, but I think that's going to happen.Â  I mean this is ...Â  You see already glimpses of that in Saudi Arabia and it will happen - not only in Saudi Arabia, I think everywhere in the world.Â  You cannot, for example, have still countries where women are suppressed, not only for economic reasons or political reasons but for a matter of dignity.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Much is made in the West, isn't it, of Islamists coming to power after all of this.Â  They've won in Tunisia, likely to do well in Egyptian parliamentary elections.Â  How does that fit in with the future, do you think, and how worried ... how right are the West's fears?Â  How justified are they?</p>

  <p> Â I think in a good part of the Middle East when people lost identity with the state because the state were the repressor, they wrapped themselves around their religious identity.Â  Unfortunately, in many cases it distorted interpretation of religion but an Islam that is enlightened and an Islam that is modern, adjusted to today's realities, an Islam that has been practised over centuries as a way to connect with the rest of the world and not ... and preach about freedom of religion, of Muslims and non-Muslims, about mercy, about solidarity, I don't think ...Â  In my view, if you turn these societies into democracies, if you have social justice - you know, if people start to feel dignity - all this extreme interpretation of Islam or the Bible or the New Testament will evaporate.Â  That's the way I see it.Â  I don't think it's worth talking about it or arguing with it.Â  I think it's creating the environment where the people, irrespective of their beliefs, will go for the moral code that - we all have it, probably are born with it - that we are decent human beings who would like to live together and not kill each other.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Which brings us on to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, doesn't it, because underpinning a lot of the problems in the region is that very issue?Â  You talk about the world being doomed but there are opportunities that are emerging out of all this.Â  Do you sense that that could be an opportunity, that particular issue - the Israeli-Palestinian?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ I think it's a great opportunity.Â  I think it's the first opportunity in my lifetime where I see the Israelis now, or Israel, can have peace - durable peace - with the people of the Middle East and not with the dictators.Â  But that requires adjustment of the Israeli policies, the US policies.Â  It requires building trust, mutual respect, splitting differences, but I think if we were able to once and for all settle the Israeli-Palestinian issue, the Middle East would be a different place.Â  As you know, Nick - you've lived here for a while - this is still a red flag of humiliation, of anger, in the rest of the Middle East and the feeling that the Palestinians are mistreated, the feeling that the Palestinians are not able to get their own state ...Â  It's a risk but it's a great opportunity for Israel and I hope the Israelis will see it that way.</p>

 <p> NCÂ Just one final question, if I may.Â  How do you think historians will one day look back on 2011?Â  What do you think they'll write about?</p>

 <p> MEBÂ 2000?</p>

 <p> NCÂ 2011.</p>

 <p> MEBÂ Well I hope they would write that this was the beginning, ushering a new era in the Arab world, in the Muslim world, where weÂ  - you know, finally linking up with the 21st century - where we have restored to every Arab and Muslim their sense of dignity, that everyone is entitled to.</p>
